            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO add to thoſe many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which prove and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this great Truth, That the Religion of the Holy Jeſus is Divine and moſt certainly true; I have not without reaſon judged, that the Life and Death of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, is a great demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The Chriſtian Religion was more oppoſed by this Emperor than by any preceding Heathen Perſecutors: By thoſe ſame means which eſtabliſh and aggrandize this Religion, he deſigns to ruine it. The Religion given us by the Holy Jeſus is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable for the Holineſs of its Laws: a Religion in the whole frame and model of it, ſuitable to our natural faculties; a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rendred ſo admirable by its publick Rites and Form of Divine Worſhip: a Religion made ſo illuſtrious by that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb facs="tcp:94184:3"/> Sanctity which appeared in the times of the Primitive Chriſtians: and is now, though a degenerate age, conſpicuous. In no age the Shades of Darkneſs ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Church, in which no Stars did appear. To revive the Pagan Superſtition, he endeavoured to make it reſplendent, by making the Worſhippers of Idols to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the admirable converſations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The Religion of the Holy Jeſus carries the Signatures of Heaven; it hath the impreſs of Gods Omnipotence in Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; of Gods Omniſcience in Prophecies. That he might give the precedency to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme, he with his Philoſophers who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, addicted themſelves to all ſorts of Divinations; and likewiſe they gloried in Miracles; but how falſe the one, and ridiculous the other were, this Hiſtory fully manifeſts. There was another Divine Character in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Holy Jeſus, to which they could not pretend; The Infinite Holineſs of God. Holineſs being his cheif attribute, was elucent in the enabling ſo many Millions of all ſorts, Sexes, and Ages, not only to lead the moſt exemplary lives, but to
<pb facs="tcp:94184:3"/> chuſe and endure the moſt lingring Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even unto death, rather than they would violate the Law of the Lord Jeſus, or be Apoſtates from the Religion which gives the beſt rules for living well, and from whence ſprings the ſweeteſt comforts. Produce any Religion, in any Age, which glories in ſo many Martyrs as the Chriſtian does. So true is that of <hi>Trajane</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperour, <hi>No people ſuffer ſo much for their God as Chriſtians do. Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> a great Philoſopher, and of eminent converſation, gained ſuch an eſteem, that he ſometimes had Divine worſhip given him, and was ambitious to be eſteemed <hi>Apollo.</hi> By his followers he was honoured as a Demi-God: His Diſciples took from him, the name of their lofty and refined Sect; which flouriſhed in <hi>Magna Grecia,</hi> now <hi>Calabria. Chilo,</hi> the <hi>Cratonean,</hi> a rich and potent Epicurean, being incenſed againſt them, raiſed the Arms of that City, and cut them off: his fury did not there ceaſe; for he led his forces, and deſtroyed them in other Cities. Let Hiſtory be appealed, then it will be evident, that Chriſtianity hath gained by perſecution, and according
<pb facs="tcp:94184:4"/> to my Reading, never was there ſuch a School of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Slaughter of them. Here <hi>Julian</hi> was at a loſs to ruine Chriſtianity; he opened the Schools of Philoſophers, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the flowing Tongues and Pens of Orators: yet nothing could raiſe the minds of Heathens to do and ſuffer, as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did, for the Glory of God. Add to all his Stratagems, his bloody Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he muſt really be judged one of the greateſt perſecutors in the World: Yet this Chriſtian Religion Triumphed. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by their Divine Philoſophy and Gracious Lives; the Patience and Courage which they ſhewed in their greateſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; they bafled the Pens of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and blunted the Swords of Tyrants; and the Laurel of the Church flouriſhed, notwithſtanding the Artifices which this great enemy of our Faith uſed to extirpate it. But now Chriſtianity is oppoſed by another ſort of perſons: The School of <hi>Epicurus</hi> is now reviv'd and opened; that School which was laughed at, not only by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but by all the wiſeſt Men in the world, now ſeems to flouriſh. The firſt
<pb facs="tcp:94184:4"/> that encourag'd it, as appears to me, was <hi>Beregard</hi> at <hi>Piſa,</hi> which is delivered to us in his <hi>Piſane Circle.</hi> It gain'd a greater ſtrength and eſteem in the world by <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> his Diſſertations upon the Tenth Book of <hi>Laertius;</hi> they both were great men, and really had been as great as any of their Age, if their Sentiments had not given a deſperate wound to Religion, and made way for <hi>Hobs</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If there be a Fatal neceſſity, as <hi>Hobs</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi> directly affirm, How can <hi>Moſes</hi> his Narrative of the Worlds Creation be believ'd? And indeed, what Religion, Juſtice and Virtue is there? and whether that which <hi>Beregard</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> ſpeak, <hi>de facto libertate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Motoris,</hi> according to <hi>Epicurus</hi> his <hi>Dogma,</hi> intimate not the ſame, I am vaſtly miſtaken. Religion, which is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Miracles and Prophecies, receives an Authority from the Broad Seal of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They who deny both, vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give a fatal wound to the Eternal Goſpel. He that Reads what <hi>Beregard</hi> ſaith of Miracles, and his ſcoffing at Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Fire, comparing them to the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:94184:5"/> of <hi>Orlando Furioſo;</hi> and what they both affirm concerning Fate and Liberty of the Will, may eaſily conjecture what they intend. In words they expreſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both; but aver what is a real Miracle or Propheſie cannot be known, but by the determination of the Church. <hi>Hobs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting this, he, that he might not ſeem to deny Miracles or Prophecies, doth ſo ſpeak of them, as they muſt not be eſteemed ſo, except the Supreme Magiſtrate ſaith they are ſo. <hi>Spinoſa</hi> throws off the vail, and makes all Prophecies to be but mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures: And tells us, that <hi>a Miracle cannot be granted in Truth: If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Miracle depended upon the Judgement of the Eccleſiaſtical or Civil Power, there was no Miracle or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; for either the Sentence they paſs is true, or not: if true, then the exiſtence of a Miracle precedes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Church, or Civil Power.</hi> The determination of the nature of a thing, can't depend upon the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, but upon the nature of the thing it ſelf. That is a true judgement, which agrees with that thing on which the judgement
<pb facs="tcp:94184:5"/> is paſſed. This is a moſt unreaſonable and abſurd Paralogiſm, on which depends, and runs through, the Divinity, Ethicks, and Politicks of <hi>Hobs</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa;</hi> That the worſhip given in Religion is Divine, becauſe determined by the Magiſtrate; or a Law juſt, becauſe eſtabliſh'd by Authority; or the publick management of affairs is prudent, becauſe the Magiſtrate thinks ſo: If not true, then their Sentiments are ſo; for there may be a Miracle and Prophecy which the Magiſtrate judgeth not ſo. Let them caſt what vail they pleaſe over their Sentiments, it may eaſily appear to a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Eye, that they believe there is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle or Prophecy. Theſe are the perſons who employ their Natural and Acquired parts to deſtroy Chriſtianity: Nay, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the true ground of Juſtice and Civil Society, they caſt a Reproach upon God and Humane Nature. Satan gives, I hope, his laſt effort, which will be of no long continuance, by reaſon that thoſe weapons which have lain in corners, and become ruſty and unſuccesful for ſome Ages, he hath Furbiſhed, Poliſhed and Whet, not only to baniſh Chriſtianity, but Goodneſs, true
<pb facs="tcp:94184:6"/> Reaſon, Juſtice, and the laſting Ligatures of well-regulated Societies. This makes a true Chriſtian to glory and triumph, that Chriſtianity can't leave the World, before its diſſolution, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> whilſt Men are in the World, who by Reaſon are guided, and by whom juſt Laws are Enacted. The Enemies with which the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Fathers, perſons of prodigious Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety, conteſted, and vanquiſhed, acknowledged a God, a Divine Providence, the Immortality of the Soul, Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Miracles: that Goodneſs and Juſtice took their meaſures from an Eternal Reaſon. They granted that God ought to be appeaſed by Sacrifices, and honoured with all Oblations of Praiſe and Obedience. With theſe the Chriſtian Heroes fought. The Controverſy is stated in the Remarks. But muſt our glorious Religion be Eclipſed by the Shades of Darkneſs, which iſſue from the bottomleſs Pit, through the Pens and Tongues of thoſe who have reviv'd the Dogma's of <hi>Epicurus?</hi> The Narrative which <hi>Speizelius</hi> gives, <hi>Cap. 18. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſmo Literatorum.</hi> The Blaſphemies which are belched in ſome Atheiſtical <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94184:6"/> Clubs, and the Impieties which are gloried in, at many Tables, makes the hairs of good men ſtare! Such frequent Blaſphemies, ſtrikes perſons with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt horror, and makes our Tears to be our Meat and Drink, whilſt they ſo wickedly ſay, <hi>Where is God?</hi> Be not diſcouraged, God Reigns a King for ever; the Church will remain as the faithful witneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Church is a Golden Candleſtick; the Candleſtick may be removed from one place to another, but it will continue, ſince the Candleſtick is of Gold, a durable metal. <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is the moſt malignant peſtilence; but not ſo diffuſive as Antichriſtianiſm. My Lord of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> thus, <hi>All my life long I had a ſecret value and reverence for an honeſt man, and lov'd morality in others; but I had form'd an odd Scheme of Religion to my ſelf, which would Solved all which God or my Conſcience might force upon me: yet was I not ever well reconcil'd to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Chriſtianity; nor had that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for the Goſpel of Chriſt as I ought to have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly he who hath an eye, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:94184:7"/> to behold and contemplate this univerſe; <hi>quo nihil Illuſtrius,</hi> when he ſeriouſly conſiders the Magnitude, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Beauty of the World, the Luſtre, motion and influence of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, muſt needs conclude, that they were the product of Infinite Power, Beauty and Goodneſs. The ſpreading infection is Antichriſtianiſm: the buſineſs of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity gave the greateſt trouble to my Lord <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> Amongſt thoſe wicked perſons who have debauched their reaſon, nothing more frequent than cavils againſt, and jeſts thrown upon Religion. Hence how witty are they, when they jeer, <hi>Light is come into the World, hang out your new Lights.</hi> The greateſt myſteries are thoſe of the Trinity, and Incarnation; In theſe Chriſtianity glories and Triumphs: it owns, as certain, that the Son of God, who aſſumed our nature, is Coeternal with the Father. To hear an addle head, to ſay, <hi>Can a Son be as old as his Father?</hi> is to hear that, than which, nothing is more ridiculous. A groſs miſtake to meaſure a Carnal, by a Spiritual Generation; as ſoon as ever there is a Sun there is light. The
<pb facs="tcp:94184:7"/> Wiſe God being Eternal, the Son of God, who is his Wiſdom, and Word, muſt be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. Muſt we boggle at our Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by reaſon of theſe Myſteries; when every thing preſented to us, to underſtand the nature of it, is difficult? To ſcruple at that Religion, (which in the whole frame, is of ſo Divine Compoſure) becauſe of ſome myſteries, is a greater frenzy than by reaſon the explanation of the nature of the Sun, and its motion, is attended with a Thouſand difficulties, to refuſe its light and influence. Admirable are the words of <hi>Picus Mirandula: Magna inſania E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelio non credere,</hi> &amp;c. It is a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious folly not to believe the Goſpel; the Truth of which the blood of Martyrs Seals; the Tongue of the Apoſtles proclaims it: Miracles eſtabliſh it: inanimate Creatures, nay, the Devils themſelves acknowledge it. But it is a higher pitch of frenzy, to embrace the Goſpel, and yet to live as though he was ſatisfied in the falſity of it. Chriſtianity having, for near Seventeen hundred years; continued her Triumphs; the victories which our Religion hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over all ſorts of Enemies, manifeſts its
<pb facs="tcp:94184:8"/> veracity, and the Divine Power protecting of it. What methods were uſed under this Apoſtate Prince to deſtroy it? the Devil had gained to himſelf a great Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a great Scholar. As I have ſeen <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> drawn, ſtanding upon a Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, having a Sword in one hand, and a Book in the other, with his <hi>Lemma ex utro<expan>

                  </expan> Caeſar.</hi> So I may ſay of <hi>Julian,</hi> that he was <hi>tam Marte qua Mercurio.</hi> This perſon, thus accompliſhed was inveſted with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: whereby Learning and Policy, Valour and Vigilance, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power, were prepared and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deſtroy that Goſpel which is Eternal, but all in vain. Shall <hi>Atheiſm</hi> now be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent? or Antichriſtianiſm gain in thoſe Kingdoms, where Jeſus Chriſt is adored? God forbid. Nor can they, except the evil Lives of Chriſtians cauſe the Divine anger to waſte his own Vineyard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his Golden Candleſtick. Chriſtianity gives the moſt effectual means, and the higheſt motives. The duties of it are the moſt excellent; Faith, Hope and Charity are terminated through Jeſus Chriſt in God: by whom there is a clear knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:94184:8"/> of God. Through Faith there is a raiſed confidence and Hope in God: by theſe are produced a Heavenly and Seraphic Love; and 'tis a ſhame for thoſe who profeſs this Chriſtianity, not to lead more Celeſtial Lives. It is moſt neceſſary for Chriſtians to vindicate their Religion. Chriſtianity will conquer all its Adverſaries. The Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of which will never wither; whoſe Triumphs are Eternal. Its the undoubted intereſt of every perſon, cordially to embrace it, and ſeriouſly to profeſs it. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>is he, that is not offended in me.</hi> 'Tis for every Chriſtian with Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate me from the Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> He that lives to Chriſt, governs his converſation by the moſt excellent Rules of Wiſdom: he Lives to Felicity, he Lives to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> the Great left Three Sons, <hi>Conſtantius, Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtance;</hi> he had, amongſt his other Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, one <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who was Married to Two Wives, the firſt of which was <hi>Galla,</hi> of whom <hi>Gallus;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Baſilina</hi> a Religious Princeſs, of whom <hi>Julian</hi> was born in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94184:10"/> An. 332. Some good Authors report, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was killed by Poyſon, which his Bro-thers <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Abenblavius</hi> had given him, which cauſed him to give Letters to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> formerly Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> then of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to his Son <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> in which he adviſed him to have a Severe Eye upon his Uncles. After he was inveſted with the <hi>Eaſtern-Purple,</hi> he cut off both his Uncles; and had proceeded to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> if the Sickneſs of the one had not been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably gueſt, that Death would ſpare the hands of the Executioner: and the other was ſo young, that his tender Years were Orators for him. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere humour in <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Barrenneſs of <hi>Euſebia,</hi> which moved him, in caſe he had no Children, to leave his Empire to his Couſins: both which were ſent to a place called <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellum,</hi> a ſtately and Royal Palace, at the foot of the <hi>Aegoean</hi> Mountains, which was adorned with moſt curious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Gardens, and thoſe enriched with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94184:10"/> the Silver Streams of moſt pleaſent Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: There was nothing wanting for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, exerciſe, and retirement: And there they had Maſters appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in all ſorts of Learning; and to fit them for buſineſs, they were taught thoſe exerciſes, which were Congruous to their Age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julian</hi>'s Maſter in the Liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences was one <hi>Mardonius,</hi> a <hi>Scythian,</hi> and <hi>Eunuch,</hi> that taught his Mother <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod:</hi> It was he, who firſt inſtilled <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Principles into <hi>Julian,</hi> to whom he would often ſay, I know one way to make a man good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and no other will I Learn. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> was jealous leaſt his Kinſman might waver in his Riligion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed ſome of his Courtiers diligently to obſerve him, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all means poſſible to find out his inclinations: And that he might be confirm'd in the Chriſtian Religion, he was committed to the care of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> who by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers ſide was allyed to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> by reaſon of which affirnity he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94184:11"/> was very much in favour with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. This <hi>Euſebius</hi> was one of the <hi>Lapſi,</hi> who ſacrificed, during the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced that Hereſy; and by him <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> might take ſome diſtaſte at Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for he was a cruel and evil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To the Liberal Sciences, <hi>Julian</hi> added the ſtudy of Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, by reading the Scriptures, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Lectures of Chriſtian Divines, and pretended thereby, not only to endeavour the obtaining the knowledg of thoſe Divine things, which conduce to Speculation; but likewiſe of thoſe, which compoſe the manners of men, and render their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation Heavenly. In his <hi>16th</hi> Year, he entred into Holy-Orders, and was made Deacon, and publickly read the Holy-Bible; he enriched Churches, and vaſtly offered at the Tombs of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, but all his pretenſions were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hipocritical; for by theſe Colours he indeavoured to ingratiate himſelf into the ſavour of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> that he might not ſuſpect him to have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94184:11"/> of aſpiring to the Empire: But the Heavens detected his Hipocriſy; for as he intended to build a Temple to <hi>Mammantus</hi> a Martyr, an Earthqunke; hindered him from laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which was a Propheſy of thoſe Indignities which he intended to do to Chriſtians and Martyrs. In his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Maximus</hi> ſuceeded <hi>Mardonius,</hi> an Epheſian Philoſopher, with whom he went to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where he fell into the acquaintance of <hi>Edeſius,</hi> and <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicus,</hi> great <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and greater Enemies to Chriſtianity. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him more in <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and he to diſſemble his intentions, and deceive <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> applyed himſelf more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly to the ſtudy of the ſacred Books; not to comfirm his Faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate his Life, but to furniſh himſelf with Arguments out of the Holy Text to confute it. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> having out off <hi>Gallus,</hi> was ſuſpicious of <hi>Julian,</hi> and therefore commanded him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at <hi>Millain,</hi> where he was accus'd for being a joynt <hi>Conſpirator</hi> with his Brother <hi>Gallus:</hi> And to increaſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94184:12"/> it was alledged, that he left the Palace <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and went into <hi>Aſia;</hi> to which he anſwered, that he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Emperors knowledg; who gave him leave to ſee his Brother, and encouraged him in his travails into <hi>Aſia,</hi> for the acquiſition of Learning. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Courtiers urg'd his Ruin, which was prevented by the Empreſs. Thus avoiding the danger, he was ſent to <hi>Athens,</hi> then the moſt flouriſhing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy</hi> in the World; This not only pleas'd him for the ſake of Learning, but <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> where in both he thought to make a proficiency. At <hi>Athens</hi> he was initiated among'ſt the <hi>Eluſinians</hi> to perform their Sacred Rites to <hi>Ceres,</hi> and was one of the Prieſts of the <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidoe.</hi> Theſe things he tranſacted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and there he was known to <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The barbarous Nations having paſt the <hi>Rhine,</hi> entred into <hi>Gaul</hi> and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully waſted that Country; the news whereof being brought to <hi>Conſtantious,</hi> he profeſſ'd himſelf unable to manage the Empire alone, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94184:12"/> his Council, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to create <hi>Julian, Coeſar:</hi> From which his Council endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, by propoſing to him the Example of <hi>Gallus;</hi> and encouraged him to ſuſtain the burden of Empire, by enminding him of thoſe great Victories, that he had obtain'd againſt Rebels and Barbarians; but nothing could prevail, for he was reſolv'd to create a <hi>Coeſar:</hi> and the Empreſs urging the preferring a Kinſman to any perſon elſe, he recalls <hi>Julian</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> changes his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Cloak into the Purple, and gives him his Siſter <hi>Hellena</hi> to Wife. They were married at <hi>Vienna;</hi> from thence <hi>Julian</hi> was commanded to carry his Army into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he pretended to give a favour to the <hi>Othodox</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. In the Eaſt, the famous <hi>Nazianzen</hi> commended <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> In the Weſt <hi>Hilarius</hi> writes a bitter Invective againſt him. The Endeavours of <hi>Julian</hi> were, by a deadly policy, to Encourage Chriſtians againſt Chriſtians. The Weſtern Church was not much diſturb'd by <hi>Arrianiſm: Conſtantius</hi> favoured that <hi>Hereſy. Julian</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94184:13"/> being conſtituted <hi>Coeſar</hi> in the Weſt, his aim being at the Eagles, endeavoured to incenſe the Weſtern Chriſtians againſt <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> whoſe Courtiers being for the moſt part <hi>Arrians,</hi> perſwaded him to perſecute the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians. By this device <hi>Julian</hi> imagin'd there was a way made to diſunite Chriſtians; but I cannot find any of the Weſtern Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans favouring his Rebellion againſt his Maſter. After <hi>Julian</hi> was created <hi>Coeſar,</hi> he preſently betakes himſelf to Arms, marches into <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſubdues a great part of it; and after he had obtain'd ſome ſmall Victories, he goes to Sens (now <hi>Triers)</hi> thither the <hi>Barbarians</hi> bring a numerous Army, whom he durſt not fight, by reaſon ſome of his Legions was abſent, and therefore he contains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the City which the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> beſeiged: but he contemning their preſumption, prepares to to fight: both Armies meet, the fight was bloody, a long time dubious, at laſt victory hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the <hi>Romans,</hi> of whom in that Battel dyed 243. The <hi>Almains</hi> fled, of whom 6000 bodies were found lying in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94184:13"/> the field; beſides multitudes of Corps that could not be reckon'd, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down the River. <hi>Conodamarius</hi> King of thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> being taken, was civilly receiv'd by <hi>Julian,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he died of a <hi>Lethargy</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Victory, by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Acclamation of the Army, he was ſaluted Emperor: but his deſign being not as yet ripe he ſeverely rebuk'd the Soldiers. He often fought with the <hi>Almains,</hi> whom he frequently diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and at laſt at their humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he concluded a firm Peace with them. He baffled the <hi>Franci,</hi> and ſetled <hi>Gaul; Conſtantius,</hi> being troubled at the fame of <hi>Julian,</hi> and fearing leſt he might create ſome new troubles, ſent <hi>Decentius</hi> a <hi>Tribune</hi> to fetch away from him all his old Soldiers: the reſt of the Army was againſt it, but <hi>Julian</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a great deſire to ſatisfie the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: whereupon he ordered them to march by <hi>Paris,</hi> where he then lay; he fails not to meet them in a Village near the City, and as his manner was, by commending thoſe whom he knew,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94184:14"/> and putting every one in mind to do valiantly, in a pleaſant Oration he ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated them to go chearfully unto the Emperor, whoſe power was very ample, and by whom they ſhould get ſignal rewards; and the more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to treat them that were thus to depart, he invited the principal Officers of them to a Feaſt, and willed them confidently to prefer what lawful Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they could readily think of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might pleaſure them. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus liberally entertain'd, took their leave of him extraordinarily troubled, that they ſhould be ſeparated from ſo exellent a Prince, and from their Native Soil: This was a perfect diſcovery of <hi>Julians</hi> intentions. At night the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being incens'd, haſtned to Court, and with impetuous clamors called <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Auguſtus;</hi> but he by a ſeeming anger diſſembled his intentions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them till the morning; as ſoon as it was light, they repaired to Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and with more fervant acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unanimouſly ſaluted him <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus;</hi> he pretended a refuſal, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94184:14"/> more increaſed the Soldiers acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: whereupon tho' he feigned a greater unwillingneſs, yet he aſſented to their importunities: They deſir'd him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a white <hi>Diadem,</hi> the <hi>Enſign</hi> of the Empire: He ſaid he had none. They required his Empreſſes, he refuſeth it, being a <hi>Feminine Ornament:</hi> whereupon one <hi>Marcus</hi> took his Collar from his neck, and put it upon the head of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian:</hi> he pretends he could make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Thus with high diſſimulation he receives the Empire, bountifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Soldiers, and commands them to appear the next morning in the Fields, where he made to them an eloquent Oration, in which he commends their former actions, and promiſes repeated Obligations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> after he had created <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Coeſar,</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee the Glory of that City; he was tranſported at the ſight of thoſe curious and great pieces, which were the beauty of it: He thought many of them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable: Coming to the <hi>Forum Troja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> in the midſt of which ſtood the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94184:15"/> Great Horſe, on whoſe back <hi>Trajan</hi> was engraven, viewing this, he ſaid, he would cauſe the like to be made: To which <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince of the Blood Royal, reply'd, <hi>Command, O Great Emperor, a ſtable to be built equal to this, and then let the Horſe come after to take up as Large a Room in it.</hi> This Prince being asked, what Opinion he had of <hi>Rome,</hi> replied, <hi>That in this he took content, that their Men were alſo Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> The pleaſures, and repoſe, that he intended to receive in that City, was diſturbed by the News, that the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Nations, beyond the <hi>Iſther,</hi> took Arms to diſturb the Empire; upon which he leaves <hi>Rome,</hi> goes to <hi>Illiricum,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Sirmium,</hi> where he keeps his Court, and puts his Soldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Winter quarters. At the Spring of the Year, he carries his Army beyond the <hi>Iſther,</hi> and deſtroys the the <hi>Quati,</hi> and <hi>Sarmali,</hi> for which, in the acclamations of his Soldiers, he was called <hi>Secundus Sarmaticus.</hi> Whilſt he was buſied, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> threatens him with a Civil-war, and <hi>Sapor, King of Perſia</hi> with a forreign.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94184:15"/> He being truly informed, that <hi>Sapor</hi> had brought a Vaſt Army to the Banks of <hi>Tigris, Sapor</hi> being buſied with ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, delayed the paſſing of his Army over <hi>Tigris,</hi> 'Till the Prieſt had aſſur'd him of Victory by lucky ſigns: News was brought to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> that the Prieſts gave <hi>Sapor</hi> no encouragement, but told him the <hi>Omens</hi> were unlucky, and that thereupon he had returned to <hi>Perſia. Conſtantius</hi> (being thus freed from that danger, and having heard that <hi>Julian</hi> had paſſed <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Illiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and was haſting into <hi>Thrace)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with all imaginable ſpeed, to <hi>Hieropolis,</hi> where, when his Army ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz'd, he ſummon'd them to appear before him; and ſtanding upon a high Tribunal, with a chearful aſpect, and with moſt pathetick words, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them to march with him, and fight with ſingular unanimity and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> whom he juſtly charged with ingratitude and rebellion. The Soldiers teſtified their reſentment of his Oration with moſt applauding acclamations; and with indignation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94184:16"/> ſhaking their Spears, paſſionately deſir'd to be led againſt <hi>Julian.</hi> The joy which he conceiv'd at this affectionate carriage of his Soldiers, caus'd him immediately to march to <hi>Antioch,</hi> from thence to <hi>Tarſus,</hi> where he fell into an Ague, which not being vehement, he throught by his Travail he might remove. Though dangerous and troubleſom ways he carried his Army to <hi>Mopſue</hi> in <hi>Cilicia</hi> at the foot of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> from whence on the morning he attempted a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, but his diſeaſe grew exceſſive, the Feaver violently increaſed, all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines proved ineffectual, and there on the 44. year of his age according to <hi>Victor,</hi> in the 40. to <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>October</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julian</hi> being rais'd to the Empire, whilſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was embroil'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wars, endeavour'd to ſtrengthen his intereſt, and obliges his Soldiers to him by an Oath, which none refuſeth except one <hi>Nebridius,</hi> not out of averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Julian,</hi> but tenderneſs of his of Oath; to whom he thus addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Sr, <hi>I am bound by my Oath to pay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94184:16"/> all Loyalty to</hi> Conſtantius, <hi>to whom I am further engag'd for thoſe many Favours he hath ſhewed unto me; against whom, if I ſhould take up Arms, I ſhould be ungreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and irreligious:</hi> At the hearing of which words, the Soldiers would have torn him in pieces, if he had not been protected by <hi>Julian,</hi> at whoſe feet he throws himſelf, and begs his right hand, to teſtifie that he ſhould be ſecured; to whom <hi>Julian</hi> generouſly replies, <hi>I give you liberty to go wether you will: but if I give you my right hand, what ſhall I keep for my Friends, in caſe you attempt any thing againſt my Perſon and Empire?</hi> Thus with all ſpeed he carries his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> poſſeſſes himſelf of the Straits of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Illyricum;</hi> defeats <hi>Lucinianus</hi> one of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Generals; comes to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which City receives him with all the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Honour: from thence he wrote an Invective againſt the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Tenullus</hi> Prefect of <hi>Rome</hi> read in the Houſe: to which the Senate anſwer'd with Submiſſiveneſs, <hi>Authori tuo Reverentiam regamus.

            <p>The news of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s death was brought to <hi>Julian,</hi> then at <hi>Conſtontinople,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Aquileia,</hi> which was no ſooner receiv'd, but the Citizens and Soldiers threw open their Gates to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, Julians</hi> Commander of that Army that then beſieg'd it; and to obtain their pardon, <hi>Nigrinus</hi> and two of there Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Citizens are delivered into their hands, who commanded <hi>Nigrinus</hi> to be burn't, and the other to be Beheaded. If I durſt conjecture the reaſon, why both old, and new <hi>Rome</hi> ſo ſuddenly revolted to <hi>Julian,</hi> I would not impute it to the inſtability of Citizens, but to <hi>Conſtantiu</hi>'s ſeverity a gainſt the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians, and <hi>Julian</hi>'s Hipocriſy: For whiſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> (miſerably ſeduc'd by his <hi>Arrian</hi> Flatterers) perſecuted thoſe who defended the Holy Trinity; <hi>Julian</hi> favours them, not out of love to Religion, but Ambition. <hi>Hilarius,</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> received no trouble from <hi>Julian,</hi> which perhaps might be the Cauſe of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94184:17"/> that holy Man's too ſevere Invective againſt <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Julian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to the Empire, he made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, and was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man of great Spirit and parts. Though he was very Superſtitious, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to dreams and prophecies, yet after he was created <hi>Coeſar,</hi> when at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſhaking his Spear, the roundle fell down, and the handle remained, his Courtiers looking upon it as <hi>Ominous,</hi> he with a preſent Courage ſaith, <hi>Let no Man be difraid, I have that ſure which I hold.</hi> Nothing more becomes a Great Prince, than an undaunted mind, which is able to raiſe the Spirits of his Soldiers, dejected by a preſent Accident. What greater Vice is there, than that of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy? <hi>Julian</hi> with the greateſt privacies applies himſelf to Idolatrous practices, and devotes himſelf to all Paganiſh Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yet at the ſame time he keeps the Chriſtian Feſtival, peculiarly the Feaſt of <hi>Epiphany;</hi> and performs his devotion to Chriſt, in the Congregation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94184:18"/>
            <p>The news of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpread through the Eaſt, he was with wonderful applauſe and unanimous Acclamations receiv'd by the <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitans:</hi> and to ingratiate himſelf into the affections of the People, he puniſhes ſome of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Soldiers and Friends, whoſe Ambition and Avarice had waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Provinces with grievous Taxes and Tributes; which he releaſed, and furniſhed the Cities with infinite ſtore of grain, and all ſorts of Proviſion. That he might reconcile Chriſtians to him, he reſtored the Biſhop which <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had baniſhed. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his fear being removed, he then diſcovered his Intentions, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that the Temple ſhould be ſet open, that Beaſts for Sacrifice ſhould be preſented before the Altars; and that the Worſhip of the gods ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived: and to effectuate, and ſtrengthen this deſign, ſo digeſted, he admitted the Chriſtian Biſhops (which were at diſſention, together with the people, (which were divided into Schiſms) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94184:18"/> that having appeaſed and ended all civil diſcords amongſt themſelves, every man ſhould confidently follow his own Religion, without any impeachment whatſoever: Which was for this end, that as this liberty increaſed diſſentions, ſo he might not fear the multitude of them: Accordingly <hi>Julian</hi> commanded, that confiſcated eſtates ſhould be reſtor'd to the owners, that no perſon ſhould offer an injury or diſgrace to the Chriſtians, and that they ſhould not by any violence be forc'd to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. This he did not in favour of the Chriſtians, whom he implacably hated; for his vizar being thrown off, this monſtrous Apoſtate (who very well knew what deadly enemies the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were to Idolatry, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being vers'd in the Myſtery of Chriſtianity) endeavoured to diſgrace them, and ruin their Religion. He faſtidiouſly called the Chriſtians, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans.</hi> He opened the Temples of Idols, repair'd the ruinous, rebuilt the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; he erected Altars, reviv'd the Paganiſh Laws and Cuſtoms, inſtituted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94184:19"/> Orders of Prieſts, encourag'd all perſons who profeſs'd Idolatry, received Heathen Philoſophers with great honour, and entertain'd <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Cynick</hi> with a carriage, which ſhew'd him more Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious than Philoſophical.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which he the more lov'd, becauſe it was the place of his Nativity (after he had animated his Soldiers by an eloquent Oration, and large Donatives) he marches to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> the beauty of the Eaſt. The multitude of People that there waited on him, filling the Air with loud Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, tranſported him with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary joy, which the Rites in the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of <hi>Adonis</hi> allay'd: for the Heathens celebrated the Murder of <hi>Adonis</hi> with Lamentations and outcries, which <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> eſteem'd an ill preſage. He Winters at <hi>Antioch,</hi> to make all imaginable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the <hi>Perſian</hi> expedition, to revenge thoſe injuries which were done by the <hi>Perſians</hi> upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. He was impatient of reſt, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of Glory; and dream'd of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Battels and Triumphs: and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94184:19"/> was extraordinary deſirous that the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Parthicus</hi> might be inſerted amongſt his Titles of Honour. His intimate Favourite <hi>Saluſtius,</hi> Prefect of <hi>Gaul,</hi> diſſwaded him from that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, from which he was alſo diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſome ill <hi>Omens;</hi> but nothing could move him. Ambaſſadors from ſeveral Nations promiſed him aſſiſtance, whom after he had generouſly entertain'd, he ſent away with a Complement, ſaying, <hi>That in no wiſe it became the dignity of</hi> Rome, <hi>to want the aid of ſtrangers; but that it was her glory to defend and aſſiſt them when they were caſt into any danger. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who was a Chriſtian, commanded to attend him with a ſufficient Army. In his Letters to that Prince, he dealt inſolently with him, baſely abuſing <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and blaſphemouſly traducing Chriſtianity. In <hi>March</hi> he left <hi>Antioch:</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April</hi> he brought his Army into <hi>Perſia,</hi> where notwithſtanding his unproſperous <hi>Omens,</hi> he continued his <hi>March.</hi> The day before, according to the mood of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he made an

He retires to his Pavilion, and ſleeps part of the Night; and by then it was day he cauſes the Trumpets to Sound: nothing but Gallantry and chearfulneſs was ſeen in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Soldiers. When he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Marches of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he rides in the head of his Army, that by his own Example he might encourage his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.

               </gap> Sailing upon <hi>Euphrates:</hi> Some ſtrong Cities Seated upon the bank of which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently took. He laid a Bridge made of Ships, on which the Army paſſed over <hi>Tigris:</hi> then the <hi>Perſians</hi> gave him Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which was courageouſly fought from morning till night: But the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Valour made the <hi>Perſians</hi> to yield: the Victory was gain'd with little loſs to the <hi>Romans:</hi> Though Two Thouſand and five hundred of the <hi>Perſians</hi> were ſlain, only Threeſcore and Ten of the <hi>Romans</hi> were killed. This made him
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94184:20"/> more confident, whereupon to reconcile <hi>Mars,</hi> he prepared many Sacrifices, all which were <hi>Ominous.</hi> Ten Bulls, the faireſt that could be procured, were intended for the Oblation; Nine of which, before they could be hail'd to the Altar, fell down dead: the Tenth broke his bonds, and running away, with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was brought back again; but being ſlain, gave <hi>Ominous</hi> ſigns, which being perceived by <hi>Julian,</hi> threw him into ſuch an indignation, that he ſwore by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he would offer no more Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to <hi>Mars;</hi> which Oath his ſudden death made him to perform. He was not yet diſcouraged, but brought his Army to <hi>Teſiphon,</hi> a City placed on the farther banks of <hi>Tigris;</hi> at the ſight of which he conceived a vaſt Joy, and promiſed to himſelf ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that he had ſwallowed up in his hopes all <hi>Perſia.</hi> But before the Walls of this City, his Victories received a Period: for <hi>Teſiphon</hi> is judged inpreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and thereupon his Council of War diſwade him from laying Siege to it. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> relates, that a Noble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94184:21"/> 
               <hi>Perſian</hi> (in imitation of <hi>Zophyrus,</hi> who pretended a defection from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that he might have the opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Babylon</hi> into his hands) flies to <hi>Julian,</hi> ingratiates himſelf into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and encouraging him to continue the War againſt <hi>Perſia,</hi> perſwades him to burn his Ships: withal promiſing, that he would be a faithful guide to his Army, to conduct them ſafely through thoſe ways in which they were to March. <hi>Julian</hi> therefore commands his Ships to be ſet on fire, reſerving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Twelve of the leſs, for the making of Bridges; the reaſon that induc'd him to this fatal Action, was a fear, leſt if his Navy was left behind, it might turn to the benefit of his Enemies. He Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that 20000 men would do him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Service at Land, than when em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Ships. His great admirer <hi>Mars,</hi> juſtifies him by the Examples of famous Princes, who have burnt thoſe Ships which have carried their Soldiers into forreign Countries, that if their innate Vertue did not make them Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larous, yet deſperation ſhould. By ſuch
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94184:21"/> facts, they let their Army know, that no other Liberty was given them, but either to Conquer or Dye. But this fact of <hi>Julians</hi> was ſo impolitick, that it may be juſtly eſteemed an Act of the Divine Providence, to infatuate the Council of a politick Apoſtate; for it proved fatal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. By this means he wanted materials to make Bridges, and his Army for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was reduced to great extremities; by the advice of his guides leaving <hi>Tigris</hi> in his March on his left hand, he paſſed into fertile Countries, but thoſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> had deſtroyed; they burnt the very Trees, and left nothing that was neceſſary to ſuſtain either Man or Beaſt. <hi>Julian,</hi> to encourage his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, lived upon thick gruel: the Army being preſs'd with theſe exigences, he in his ſleep was terrified with a dream of a falling Star, concerning which, conſulting his <hi>Southſayers,</hi> they adviſed him to ſtay in the Camp for ſome hours, but he would not. The <hi>Perſians</hi> glad of this occaſion, fell upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Camp in ſeveral places. They who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94184:22"/> gave the aſſault upon the Arrear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the whole Army; of which <hi>Julian</hi> being adviſed, with the greateſt haſt rides to recover the Battel: but amidſt his flying Soldiers, he was ſtruck with a Horſemans Javelin, of which wound he not long after dyed. This wound ſo enraged his Soldiers, that their revenge and anger were teſtified by their ratling of their Shields: For with an invincible courage they flew upon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> reſolving either to conquer or dye with their Emperor: a rare courage in the <hi>Romans.</hi> Many times it happens, that the Death of a General is the rout of an Army; but contrary was the fortune of that fight: for though the <hi>Perſians</hi> heightned their courage at the News of <hi>Julians</hi> fatal wound, darkened the Sun with the volleys of their Arrows, and oppoſed their Elephants, yet by the <hi>Roman</hi> Sword there were ſlain <hi>Mercena</hi> and <hi>Malaodares,</hi> two great Commanders of the Army, 50. great <hi>Perſian</hi> Lords, and moſt part of the Common Soldiers. The like inſtance we have in the late Wars of <hi>Gemany,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94184:22"/> in that memorable fight of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> when the invincible <hi>Guſtavus</hi> received the fatal wound, and thereto added a moſt ample teſtimony of humane vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he that was eſteemed a god, whom the world judged to have Victory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs attending on his Sword, his Corps were ſo miſerably trod on, that after the Battel was ended, there could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a diſcovery of them. His fall was ſo far from diſpiriting the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> that it edged their Swords, that had not night prevented the luſter which the Duke of <hi>Fredland</hi> gained by his Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Valour and Policy, they had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a fatal Eclipſe, and the Emperial Army a total overthrow.</p>
            <p>The loſs of the Spaniſh General in the Iſle of <hi>Rugen,</hi> gave an eminent Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> which revived the drooping concerns of that Crown.</p>

            <head>The Artifices, which <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate uſed to Deſtroy and Diſgrace Chriſtianity.</head>
            <p>THe meaſures which <hi>Julian</hi> took in his perſecutions were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of the Pagan Emperors, his Predeceſſors. Apoſtates are cruel and politick. He endeavoured by all fineneſs of Wit, to conceal his cruel Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. In Diſgrace of our Lord, he called Chriſt, the Carpenters-Son, and the Man of <hi>Galilee;</hi> and Chriſtians, <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that by odious names he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the Goſpel. He endeavoured to make his Courtiers and great Officers A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, by propoſing to them Rewards, Dignities, and preferments: and aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with all Imaginable Wit and Eloquence. <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> Brother to <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> was a Phyſitian at Court, a man of very great parts, and of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular life, an able Phyſitian, and a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94184:24"/> profound Philoſopher. Him <hi>Julian,</hi> for his learning and endowments, very much honoured, and endeavoured by all means to draw from the faith of Chriſt, but all in vain: for no eloquence, no force of Argument, nor the powerful Rhetorick of Rewards and Honours could move him; for he evades all the Artifices of <hi>Julian,</hi> by this free confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I am a Chriſtian. <hi>Julian</hi> never publiſhed any Sanguinary Edict againſt the Chriſtians, whom he knew would endure all ſorts of Tortures for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Maſter generouſly and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. The effects of <hi>Diocleſians</hi> Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries made him underſtand, that no Garden being Seaſonably watered, more flouriſhes than the Church of Chriſt, when the blood of Martyrs was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it: Yet he delighted in the Blood of Chriſtians. Murders were committed in popular tumults, which he did not puniſh, or prevent, but would palliate his cruelty, not with Religion, but the pretence of Criminal Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Helbidius,</hi> the chief Commander of the pretorian Guard, by reaſon he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94184:24"/> found him conſtant in his Religion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his Command, and being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to put him to an ignominious Death, laid Treaſon to his Charge, condemn'd him to be drawn by Wild-Horſes, and afterwards to be burnt to Aſhes. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (who during the Empire of Religious Princes, had thrown down Idolatrous Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, demoliſh't Temples, and hindred the Oblations to Heathen gods) were hurried before the Courts of Judicature and condemn'd: and if one that perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſtianity, was but accuſed of ſuch actions, though he had no hand in them, he was condemned. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all Phyſitians, Orators, and Soldiers, either to abjure their faith, or leave their profeſſion; he permitted no Chriſtian to be of the Pretorian Guard; by this means he ſhewed his moſt deadly hatred of Chriſtianity. If perſons, on ſuch an account, would abjure their faith, they would render themſelves ridiculous to the world, by preferring riches to faith: If they generouſly perſiſted, their Victory was not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for what great matter would it be,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94184:25"/> for the ſake of Religion, to contemn an Art, or Profeſſion? He removed the Croſs from the Imperial <hi>Zebarum,</hi> and inſtead of it placed the <hi>Axcilia;</hi> and to his publick Images, he cauſed the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be affixed as a god appearing out of Heaven, and reaching a Diadem and Purple to him. <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> were drawn looking upon his Picture, to teſtify by the caſt of their eyes, that in him Eloquence and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcipline Superlatively met; which he out of a deep policy commanded that unwary Chriſtians which were in his Army, by that means ſhould be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Idolatry. It was a Cuſtom in the Army to ſhew Reverence to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Emperors, which if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient mode, they did, they then gave Reverence to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then gods: not many of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans perceived this fraud: for if they denyed the doing of Reverence to the Images of the Emperor, they were puniſhed as Malefactors and Enemies, and Seditious Innovators to their Prince. If they did, they were in Danger of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94184:25"/> Idolatry: Thus did he varniſh his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious deſigns. It was uſual at ſome ſet times of the year, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to reward their Soldiers. <hi>Julian,</hi> when the Largeſſes were appointed to be given, commanded that Fire and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe ſhould be prepared, that when the Soldiers received their donatives, they might caſt incenſe upon the fire. By this device he entrapped the Covetous and unwary Soldiers, who being caught in this ſnare, fell into Idolatry. Some perceiving this cunning trick, preferring Religion to all gain, or honour, refuſed the Emperors Largeſs: Some through fear, others bribed by Coveteouſneſs, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly communicated with <hi>Pagans</hi> in their Rites: others were deceived, and through Ignorance complied. Of theſe, ſome coming to a Feaſt with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Soldiers, when they drank, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy manner of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, invocated the name of Chriſt: to whom one that was preſent, returns, how dare you invocate that Chriſt, whom you have ſo lately denied? For when you received the Emperors Money,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94184:26"/> you offered Incenſe. At which words they were ſtruck with horrour, and ran up and down the Streets bitterly bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fact, calling God, and all his Saints to witneſs, that they did it out of Ignorance: that they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and did remain in the Faith of Chriſt. When they came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, they threw the Gold at his feet, and deſired that they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate their Crime by Death: and as by fire they Sinned, ſo by fire they might Suffer: But <hi>Julian,</hi> though grieveouſly incenſed, did not not put them to Death, but caſhier'd and baniſhed them. To diſcountenance Chriſtianity, he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Chriſtians to execute any Civil power, ſaying, that thoſe that deſerved Death, ought not to be truſted with the Sword of Juſtice; Though he made an Edict, that no Chriſtians ſhould remain in the Army, yet ſome for their valour and fidelity, he retained in his Service; as <hi>Jovian,</hi> who was a great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Army in the expedition againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Valentinian.</hi> In the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94184:26"/> the Altar of <hi>Fortune:</hi> upon which, to offer Sacrifice, he went, accompanied with his Courtiers and great Officers amongſt whom was this <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whoſe place being immediately before the Emperor, thoſe to whom the care of the Church, or holy things was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſtanding in the Porch, with Holy-water, to caſt upon thoſe which came to worſhip, ſome of it fell upon <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi> which threw him into ſuch an Holy indignation, that he gave him that threw the water, a box on the ear, and ſaid, that by that dirty water he was not expiated, but polluted, and tore ſo much of his Garment off as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell upon; which being done in the pr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Julian,</hi> caſt him into an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary anger, and ſo he baniſhed him. At <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he endeavoured to force the Chriſtians to Idolatry, by famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; for though all things, which were for the food of Man, as Bread and Fleſh were publickly expoſed to Sale, yet he polluted them by offering them up to Idols; whereby the Chriſtians muſt either dye by Famine, or to preſerve
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94184:27"/> their Lives, muſt give an honour to the Heathen-gods; but being in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they were reſcued miraculouſly. My Author reports, that they conſulted <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Martyr as their Oracle, by whom they were counſelled, that inſtead of Bread and Meat they ſhould eat boil'd wheat, which they did, and were thereby ſuſtained, and freed from the ſuſpition of Idolatry. <hi>Julian</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this device fruſtrated, permits Victuals freely to be ſold. During that Policy of <hi>Julian,</hi> the Rich ſhewed their Liberality to the Poor, in the beſtowing bountifully amongſt the indigent, boil'd Wheat: In memorial of which, at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> on the Aniverſary of that Martyr, the rich Chriſtians diſtribute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the poor, boild wheat. After he had tarried at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ten Months, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> on the other Side of the water, there came to him from the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> 3 Ambaſſadors, <hi>Man, Sabel,</hi> and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> which he againſt the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons injurioſly treated. The perſons of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are Sacred, and he knowing they were Chriſtians, invites them to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but they refuſing he condemns them

He paſſes on to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which he finds (for the great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſt part) by aterrible Earthquake reduc'd to duſt; the remaining Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him not in triumph, but in ſad poſtures and garbs, he comes to <hi>Ceſaria</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> the inhabitants of which City were almoſt Chriſtians. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity which they profeſſed was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make them hate them: but their Demoliſhing the Temples of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Appollo,</hi> and afterwards that of <hi>Fortune,</hi> caſt him into ſo deadly a Rage, that he was angry with the Heathen for permitting it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the moneys that belong'd to Churches, to be brought into the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury, and all the Clergy to be enrold in the Army, and laid many heavy Taxes upon Men, Women and Children, that were Chriſtians, and ſwore, that he would never ceaſe from afflicting that City, nor ſuffer the <hi>Galileans</hi> (for ſo he contumeliouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Chriſtians) to keep their Heads upon their Shoulders, if they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94184:28"/> did not rebuild thoſe Idol Temples which they had burnt, and demoliſhed. At <hi>Ancira, Baſilius</hi> a Presbyter was ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a Publick place, and ſeeing Sacrifices offered, he expreſſes a great anger, and prayeth to God, that no Chriſtian may fall into that Deluſion; after which, being grievouſly tormented, he ſuffered a glorious Martyrdom. <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> glory in thoſe who ſuffered for Chriſt, in the time of <hi>Julian:</hi> He then goes for <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in order to his <hi>Perſian</hi>-War: thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſends for <hi>Artemius</hi> Prefect of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a great honourour of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who had broke many Images and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols in pieces, for which, after his Eſtate was confiſcated, he was executed. He was a Soldier under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and a ſpectator of that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Croſs which appeared to <hi>Conſtantine. Artemius</hi> being Excecuted, the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Pagans</hi> waited for an occaſion to excecute thoſe Cruelties upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which they intended; which was thus offered: <hi>George</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> returning from the Princes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94184:28"/> Court, attended with a numerous train, as he paſſed by the Temple of <hi>Genius,</hi> caſting his Eyes upon that curious and fair pile of Building, How long, (cries he out) ſhall this Sepulcher ſtand? the Pagan Populacy hearing thoſe words fell upon <hi>George,</hi> drag'd him by his Legs, and with the greateſt Scorn tormented him. They ſeized alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dracontius,</hi> becauſe he had demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an Altar ſet up in the Mint-houſe, in which he had the greateſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And one <hi>Diodorus</hi> a great Officer, who being conſtituted Surperviſor of the building of a Church, cut of the Hair of Boys cloſe to the Head, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the wearing of locks ſmell'd of Idolatry. Theſe Three the enraged multitude Ignominiouſly and barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthered: they mangled their dead bodies, and burnt them; after which, they threw their Aſhes into the Sea. Upon this Tragedy <hi>Marcellinus</hi> makes two remarques: Firſt, theſe perſons when they were drag'd to Excecution, might have been reſcued by the Aid of Chriſtians, if they had not conceived a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94184:29"/> deadly hatred againſt <hi>Georgius,</hi> who was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and manag'd his Epiſcopal Juriſdiction with pride and cruelty. He was a great Schollar, and had one of the beſt libraries in the World. 2. It being the cuſtom of Chriſtians, religiouſly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the reliques of thoſe, who, to maintain their faith, endured all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable torments, even to a glorious death: and where they buried thoſe Sacred reliques, there they built Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and therefore the <hi>Alexandrian Pagans</hi> fearing this Honour might be done to theſe Three, caſt their Aſhes into the Sea. Whilſt <hi>Julian</hi> tarried at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was full of Chriſtians, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thoſe abuſes caſt upon him in that famous Invective called the <hi>Miſopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi> He affected a long and Philoſophical Beard, which gave an Occaſion to call him a Goat. That which moſt incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him againſt the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> was the neglect of the Temple of <hi>Daphne.</hi> He himſelf was ſo extreamly given to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that he Offered ſometimes an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Oxen at once, which made him to becalled not <hi>Sacricola,</hi> but <hi>Victimarius;</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:94184:29"/> and he cauſed on his Tomb to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven an Altar and an Oxe. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temple of <hi>Daphne,</hi> found no Sacrifices prepared; for the City had ordained none, and the Prieſt had only one poor Gooſe to Sacrifice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he makes this complaint to the Senate, Every one of you commands his Wife to give largely to the <hi>Ga-lileans,</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">but none brings things neceſſary for the performance of holy Offices to the gods. When any one celebrates his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he makes a ſumptuous Feaſt, and ſplendily entertains his Friends at a rich Table; but on the ſolemn Feaſt of the gods, no one brings Oil for the Lamps, Oblations, Sacrifice, or Incenſe.</q> 
               <hi>Julian,</hi> conſults the Oracle of <hi>Apollo Daphnick,</hi> which was famous for predictions, but now became ſilent: The ſtory of which, and the conflagration of the Temple, we cannot take from a better Pen, than that of <hi>Chriſostome,</hi> who gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them in thoſe famous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons againſt the Heathens, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his Narrative with this publick and ſolemn proteſtation; There are many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94184:30"/> alive which were Eye-witneſſes of thoſe things which I am now to relate, whom I paſſionately entreat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech, that if any thing by me be added or falſly ſpoken, they will come forth and reprove. The Emperor with a grave compoſure of Countenance aſcends <hi>Daphne,</hi> with abundance of Oblation and Sacrifices, a River of Blood was made by the flaughtered <hi>Victims,</hi> and there, with a great deal of Fervour, prayed the Oracle to reſolve him ſome things that were in his mind; to which he had this return, that the many Carcaſſes with which <hi>Daphne</hi> was filled, had rendred the Oracle ſilent. <hi>Julian,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly aſtoniſhed, haſtens preſently to the Tomb of <hi>Babylas,</hi> and commands the Coffin to be taken up, and the Chriſtians to remove the Corps, which they did, and in a religious Solemnity carried them about fourty furlongs from <hi>Daphne,</hi> and ſo interred them; all ſorts of perſons, Men and Women, Young-men and Virgins, Old-men and Children, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally encouraging one another, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms after the manner of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94184:30"/> Tranſlated the Body of <hi>Babylas.</hi> In their ſinging, they often repeated that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Confounded be all they that worſhip graven Images, that boaſt themſelves in Idols, Pſalm.</hi> 97. which ſo enraged the Emperor, that he commanded the Chriſtians to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed. <hi>Salustus</hi> Governor of the City, though a <hi>Pagan,</hi> diſſwaded him from ſuch intentions; but <hi>Julian</hi> perſiſting in his reſolution, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral Chriſtians, and threw them into Priſon, and commanded a young man, called <hi>Theodorus</hi> to be rack'd, and his fleſh to be torn; but this abated not his Chriſtian courage, for in thoſe torments he carried himſelf more like a ſpectator than a ſufferer, deſiring that new and more dreadful tortures might be added <hi>Saluſtus,</hi> admiring his conſtancy, goes to <hi>Julian,</hi> whom he counſels to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from ſuch cruel courſes, for they tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his ignominy, and to the glory of Chriſtians; whereupon <hi>Theodorus</hi> was freed from the Rack, and other Chriſtians from the Goal. The Power and Grace of God is obſervable, miraculouſly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94184:31"/> thoſe who piouſly ſuffered. This <hi>Theodorus</hi> being asked by ſome, what pain he felt during the Rack, anſwered, that he was not altogether unſenſible, but that there was a young man, that ſtood by him, which abated the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his pain; for with ſoft Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen he wiped away his Blood and Sweat, and poured cold water upon his Body, which aſſwadged his Grief. Preſently after the Tranſlation of <hi>Babylas,</hi> that famous Temple of <hi>Daphne</hi> was burnt, the diſcription of which fire, and the eloquent diſcourſe concerning it, may be read in the fore quoted Books of <hi>Chriſoſtome.</hi> The burning of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was attributed by <hi>Julian</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but moſt falſly, and maliciouſly; Yet he having this pretence, racked many Chriſtians, thinking thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort a Confeſſion, but they conſtantly and truly denyed. His arts and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in vain. The Prieſt of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he dreadfully tortured by Scourges, and the Rack, who when he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt torn in peices, profeſſ'd that the fire was the product of Divine anger, not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94184:31"/> of any humane art, or policy; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſuffered various, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous tortures, averr'd, that he could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe no perſon, and that the Temple was burnt by a fire from Heaven. <hi>Theodoret</hi> affirms, that ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Country-men teſtified that they ſaw the Temple ſet on fire by Lightning. <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> with a great deal of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, aſcribes it to the prayer and power of <hi>Babylas</hi> the Martyr. <hi>Julian</hi> being informed, that near the Temple <hi>Appollo Didymus</hi> in <hi>Militus,</hi> there was ſome Churches built in the Honour of Martyrs, wrote to the Prefect of <hi>Caria,</hi> that if they were finiſhed, and an Holy Table was placed in them, he ſhould reduce them to aſhes; if half built, he ſhould demoliſh the Walls, and raize the foundations To manifeſt his inveterate anger againſt the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Chriſtians, he ſeized upon the Sacred Veſſels and Treaſures, and ſhut up their Church-doors. The Inſtruments of this Action were three of his Fellow Apoſtates, <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Uncle to the Emperor by the Mothers ſide, <hi>Felix</hi> his Lord-Treaſurer, and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidius</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:94184:32"/> his Lord Privy Seal All theſe once profeſſed Chriſtianity; but to ingratiate themſelves with the Apoſtate, they ſhamefully diſerted their faith. No greater Enemy to Chriſtianity, than impious <hi>Renegadoes.</hi> This <hi>Julian,</hi> Prefect of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> cauſed all the rich Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Treaſures and Utenſils of the Church to be ſeized on, and baniſhed the Clergy of <hi>Antioch:</hi> only one <hi>Theodoret</hi> a Presbyter would not leave the City, whom (by reaſon the Treaſures of the Church were committed to his cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody) this <hi>Julian</hi> apprehended; and that he might make a further diſcovery of the Churches treaſure, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be grievouſly beaten, dreadfully ſcourged, and cuelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; and at laſt, his conſtant and generous refuſal made his Head to be ſtruck off. This unworthy Apoſtate, after he had entred into the Church, filthily and Sacrilegiouſly piſſed upon the Communion Table, and Box'd <hi>Euſe</hi> the Biſhop for reproving of him. <hi>Felix</hi> ſeeing the magnificence of the Sacred Utenſils (for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:94184:32"/> provided moſt ſumptuous Veſſels for the Church) belches out this moſt dreadful blaſphemy, <hi>How richly is the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>ſerv'd!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God permitted not thoſe impious Blaſphemers long to Glory in their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies: for <hi>Julian</hi> the Uncle dyed of a moſt fearful diſeaſe: his excrements and blood came not out by natural paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but, as a torrent, run out of his mouth: to whom his Wife (a Woman enobled by her conſtancy in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion) thus ſpoke, O my Husband, you ought to admire Chriſt our Saviour, who by theſe puniſhments you ſuffer, manifeſts his power: for he whom you have ſo dreadfully oppoſed, had utterly rejected you, if he had not exerted his wanted Clemency in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe puniſhments upon you. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this miſerable perſon (partly by his Wifes diſcourſe, and the heavy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which he lay) being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the cauſe of his diſeaſe, beg'd of the Emperor, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the Churches what he had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently taken from them; but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94184:33"/> refuſed, and he ſuddenly died. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> likewſe felt the Divine vengeance; for his blood leaving its natural Veſſels, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed violently out of his Mouth, and ſo he died: they both thus miſerably periſhed, when the Emperor was preparing his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Upon their Deaths, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> makes this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Whilſt he was ordering his affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he was terrified with a certain O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Sign, that took effect as the event ſhewed moſt ſurely, and with ſpeed: for by occaſion, that <hi>Felix</hi> the Treaſurer ſuddenly died of a Flux of Blood, <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf not long after fatally periſhed. The populacy in their acclamations joyned <hi>Julianus</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> with <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> thoſe having received a miſerable Death which he feared to be the prediction of his own. <hi>Elbidius</hi> eſcaped not the puniſhment of Apoſtacy, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He aſpired to the Empire, for which his Eſtate was confiſcated: his ſlight cauſed him not to feel the ſtroke of the Executioner, but he eſcaped not the hand of God; for being curſed and hated of all, he pin'd away by an
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94184:33"/> immoderate grief and ſo baſely periſhed. The Chriſtian women at <hi>Antioch,</hi> out of a great Zeal to Religion, and hatred of <hi>Julian</hi>'s impiety, by Spiritual Songs and Pſalms expos'd his Idolatry. <hi>Publio,</hi> a Noble Matron, with her Quire of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, over whom ſhe was Governeſs, as <hi>Julian</hi> paſſed by the Houſe where ſhe lived, Sang that of the <hi>Pſalmist, 115. 4. Their Idols are Silver, and Gold, the works of Mens Hands, &amp;c. and ended</hi> with this, <hi>They that make them, are like unto them, ſo is every one that truſteth in them.</hi> At which <hi>Julian</hi> was ſo enraged, that he commanded them to be ſilent when he paſſed by: but <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> ſlighted that Precept, and called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether her Quire of Virgins, who, at her Inſtigation, with greater alacrity, and louder voices, added in their ſinging of the former Pſalm, another verſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Pſalm, 68. 1. <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be ſcattered: and they that hate him, flee before him.</hi> Which ſo irritated the Emperour, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Miſtreſs of the Quire to be brought before him, whom (though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94184:34"/> ſhe was reverend for her Age and gray hairs) he gave in charge to one of his Guard, cruelly to buffet with diſgrace; but ſhe eſteemed it an Honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, perſiſted with greater Ardour in ſinging <hi>Pſalms</hi> to the deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Idolatry. There was one <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirius</hi> a notable Droll, and <hi>Mimick,</hi> whom <hi>Julian</hi> made uſe of to diſgrace Chriſtianity by bitter jeſts, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous poſtures: This <hi>Porphirius</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride and make a jeſt of Baptiſme, was baptized Jocoſely; but God Almighty brings good out of evil, and by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful power converted this <hi>Mimick,</hi> ſo that he ſeriouſly profeſſed Chriſtianity, and conſtantly perſiſted in it. Upon which, <hi>Julian</hi> forgets himſelf to be a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and was ſo incens'd (that one who expoſed Chriſt ſhould Adore him; and that the Action which was intended for the ſcorn of Religion, ſhould ſo conduce to the Honour of it) that he commanded his Head to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his Shoulders: ſuch is the goodneſs of God, and power of Grace, to make of a deriding Scorner, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94184:34"/> profeſſor of Chriſtianity; of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick,</hi> a Martyr of the Lord Jeſus. He cauſed his Army to keep their Winter-Quarters in <hi>Antioch,</hi> to oppreſs the Chriſtians there; and commanded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which was bought by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at dear Rates, to be ſold at cheap. All the Fountains and Rivers he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be polluted with heatheniſh Sacrifices: all ſorts of Proviſion he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded likewiſe to be polluted, defiled with deviliſh ceremonies, that ſo the Chriſtians might either ſtarve, or elſe by eating ſeem to give an Honour to Devils. The Chriſtians deteſted this fact of <hi>Julian,</hi> bewailed the condition that they were reduced to: yet they drank of the Waters, and did eat of the Meat. The Apoſtle hath reſolved the caſe, in 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 25. Whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles, that eat, making no question for Conſcience ſake. Julian</hi> was very Ambitious of Glory; and though he was the profeſſed enemy of Chriſtianity, yet he endeavoured to gain honour by clemency: He made no Sanguinary Laws, yet his Bloody de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94184:35"/> could not be concealed: for thoſe Cities in which the multitude of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were the greater, when in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars and ſedition they had cruelly maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred many Chriſtians, he did not puniſh, but applaud them, and would jeer Chriſtians complaining that their Brethen were ſlaughtered: of whom <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">O! illuſtious Prince, and full of Clemency, that the righteous Judge ſaith, what great matter is it that one <hi>Grecian</hi> kills ten <hi>Galileans?</hi> Is not now his cruelty manifeſt to the world? are not ſuch words a ſanguinary Edict? </q>
               <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> couldnot but with the greateſt reaſon and juſtice think, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and impunity in murthering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in Popular tumults, was moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the moſt ſevere Edict of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions: and therefore he thus bravely accuſes him of perſcutions, and removes the Vail of his pretended Clemency and Patience: he ſet out publick Edicts for the Deſtruction of our Sacred Churches. Shall I paſs by his violent ſeizing upon the Churches treaſure, a depradation that flows from coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94184:35"/> as well as impiety? The contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious handling with prophane Hands the ſacred Utenſils? ſhall I conceal the Tortures that Biſhops and their Flocks have endur'd for Religions ſake? ſhall I not mention the Pillars that have been dyed with the Blood of thoſe that have been bound to them, and dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcourged? ſhall I bury in Oblivion the feral actions of the Sagitary, who running up and down the Cities, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians more cruelly than they would do their Barbarous Enemies? The mention of all theſe things, I will wave. Who is ignorant of the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> cruelties, where the Tumultuous and Turbulent people added this to their Impieties, they filled the Temple with the Blood of Men and Beaſts, and that under the command and conduct of a certain Imperial Philoſopher? The ſeditious Conſpiracy of <hi>Eliopolis</hi> is known to all: The fearful rage of <hi>Gaza</hi> is unknown to none; by which they gained this admiration, Honour and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. The cruel Frenzy of <hi>Arethuſa</hi> made them, who were otherwiſe obſcure,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94184:36"/> famous. At <hi>Askalon</hi> and <hi>Gaza,</hi> Cities of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the Heathens rip't up the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Prieſts and Virgins, and having filled them with Barly threw them to be devoured by Hogs. At <hi>Eliopolis</hi> they cruelly maſſacred <hi>Cyril</hi> a Deacon, and having cut up his Belly, taſted his Liver. The <hi>Eliopolitans</hi> uſed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Virgins cruelly and barbarouſly, they ſtripped them naked, expoſed them to publick view, caſt all imaginable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces on them, Shav'd their heads, and then cut them in two; and that Hogs might eat their Bowels, they threw Barly on them. At <hi>Arethuſa</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grievious cruelties were exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chriſtians of the City, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon <hi>Marcus</hi> their Biſhop, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> cauſed ſome Heathen Temples to be deſtroyed, <hi>Julian</hi> being Emperor, by reaſon of the hatred which the Pagan <hi>Arethuſans</hi> had conceived againſt him, had fled; but upon notice given him, that many of his Flock were caſt into Priſon, he returned and delivered himſelf into the hands of the Citizens, who, after vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94184:36"/> and cruel Tortures, annointed his torn Body with Honey, and putting him into an Oſier Basket, hung him up in the Air to be ſtung to Death by Waſps; but even then he ſpoke mildly to them, ſaying, I am above, and you below: which was Prophetical, nothing, that glory which he was preſently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. By the Teſtimony of this City of <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> though a <hi>Pagan,</hi> it appears that the generous conſtancy of this Ancient <hi>Marcus</hi> was the glory of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the confuſion of <hi>Paganiſme.</hi> This Perſecution reacht the Weſt; for <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had removed the Altar of Victory outof the Capitol, which the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> that were Heathens redeemed, and the Eſtates of thoſe Officers and Courtiers of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> which were Chriſtians, were confiſcated, upon pretence that they grew rich with the Spoils of Heathen Temples. <hi>Julian</hi> in his Edicts was not aſhamed to inſert, that Chriſtians, when they were deſpoyled of their Eſtates, could not complain of Injury done to them, becauſe their Maſter exhorted them to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94184:37"/> Charity, and commended Poverty as the means of Perfection: And if other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts was wanting, this was always ready: ſo that the Eſtates of Chriſtians were not Secure.

In the Reign of <hi>Julian, Gordianus,</hi> Prefect of <hi>Rome,</hi> commands <hi>Januarius</hi> a Presbyter (whom he had caſt into Priſon, not as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but as a Malefactor) to appear before him; But <hi>Januarius</hi> was ſo aſſiſted with the Divine Spirit, and applies himſelf to <hi>Gordianus</hi> in great Piety and Prudence, with ſuch ſucceſs, that he converted him; whereupon at Night <hi>Gordianus</hi> comes to <hi>Januarius</hi> in Priſon, with his Lady <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and teſtifies his Repentance, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſorrow, that he had been the Author of Shedding Chriſtian Blood; and therefore upon hopes of obtaining pardon from Almighty God, and that he might ſhun Eternal Torment, he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94184:37"/> deſired to be Baptized: wherefore <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius,</hi> after he had further inſtructed, and ſtronglier confirm'd him in the Faith of the Holy Jeſus, Baptized him, with his Lady <hi>Marina,</hi> and Fifty-three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Family; concerning which, <hi>Clementianus</hi> a Tribune acquainted <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who being extreamly incens'd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes this miraculous grace of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to Magical Incantation; removes <hi>Gordianus</hi> from his Dignity, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes <hi>Clementianus</hi> in his place, who ſummons <hi>Gordianus</hi> before him, whom, after dreadful Torments, he beheads, condemns his Lady to Slavery, and Stigmatizes <hi>Januarius</hi> as a Rogue. That nothing might be wanting in <hi>Julian</hi> to extirpate Chriſtianity, he prohibited Chriſtians to teach, or to be taught humane Learning: concerning which, it is Queried, Whether by <hi>Julian</hi>'s Edict Chriſtians were only prohibited to teach, and liberty permitted that they might be taught? or whether they were prohibited both? <hi>Baronius</hi> admires that <hi>Lozymen, Socrates, Ruffinus,</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> himſelf ſhould aver, that by <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s

               <hi>Marcellinus</hi> relates, that he prohibited Profeſſors in <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Grammar,</hi> to teach Chriſtians; for which fact of his, his great Admirer juſtly ſtiles him inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and unmerciful. But this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may without great difficulty be reconciled. 'Tis acknowledged that there was in the Edict a Liberty for young Children to be taught by <hi>Pagan</hi> Maſters, that they might be corrupted; for Youth is ductile, and eaſily to be ſeduc'd by eloquence, and learned cheats; But
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94184:38"/> thoſe Children that were confirmed in their Religion, thoſe Chriſtians that were of maturer years, he permitted not the learning of Oratory, and thoſe Liberal Sciences.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94184:40"/> Tormented <hi>Julian</hi> to perceive, that many of their Wives, Children and Servants, became Chriſtians: for he found that Chriſtianity gained an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the World by the admirable converſation of its profeſſors; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to hinder its Progreſs, and to make <hi>Paganiſme</hi> equally Glorious, he built moſt ſtately Temples, and adorn'd them after the manner of Chriſtians: Upon which deſign of his, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> makes this excellent remark. <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Julian</hi>'s endeavours (ſaith he) carried only an exterior paint, an outward Pomp and Beauty; but our endeavours are to embeliſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man; We labour moſt to turn the eyes of men to behold thoſe things which are only perceived by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and Soul of Man: by theſe methods we inſtruct the People.</q> And indeed, it was eaſy for <hi>Julian</hi> to imitate the Chriſtians in the Splendor, Magnificence and Ornaments of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in Rites, and Ceremonies; theſe are exterior: but to imitate our Manners, the Holineſs of our Converſations, to raiſe the minds of Men to Heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,

            <p>That the Apoſtate might leave no means unattempted to extirpate Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, he encouraged the <hi>Jews</hi> to rebuild the Temple; which ſumptuous and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Pile, according to our Lords Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, was laid in aſhes by the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, under the Command of <hi>Veſpaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> And though he abuſed the <hi>Jews,</hi> and drolled upon their Religion, yet knowing them to be mortal Enemies to Chriſtians, and that their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would tend to the debaſement of Chriſtianity, he flattered and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. In his Epiſtle to them, he deſires their prayers for his good ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might be more fervent and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he releaſed the tribute which <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> laid upon them, of which, that there mght be no memorial, he burnt thoſe Exchequer-Rolls in which the Rates of their Impoſition was Recorded; and promiſes them, upon his Victorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Expedition, to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94184:41"/> rebuild <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and fill it with <hi>Jews,</hi> and inhabit in it himſelf, that with them he might Sacrifice to the Powerful and Gracious God. He commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to offer Sacrifice, to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned, That their Laws would not permit them to offer Sacrifice out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore deſired him to reſtore the City, and build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: which requeſt of theirs he granted, and iſſued out an Edict for the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City and Temple, and gave the charge of the ſpeedy diſpatch of this affair to <hi>Alipius</hi> Prefect of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Brittain.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Women with ſo great a Cheerfulneſs encouraged this work, that they ſold their Jewels, their Ornaments, and their Cloaths towards the defraying the Charges: they ſpared not their delicate and tender Bodies, but in their Richeſt Attire would carry Mortar towards the building of this Structure. But God wonderfully fruſtrated this enterprize. <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Baniſhment, was not at all diſmayed, but comforted his dejected

            <p>To this miraculous Fire in the Earth was added a miraculous Light in the Heavens, which appeared in the form of a Croſs, and powdered the Garments not only of Chriſtians, but Pagans, with Croſſes.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94184:48"/> that time, when he opened the Churches to Hereticks, he opened the Temples to Devils; by this means he imagined the name of Chriſt muſt utterly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated: he envying the Unity of that Church, from which he Apoſtatiſed, permitted Sacrilegious Diviſions. This is the ſo famed Juſtice of <hi>Julian:</hi> from whence it is obſervable, that he gave not theſe Immintives to the <hi>Donatists,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Juſtice, but to deſtroy the Chriſtian Religion.

The Philoſophical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which <hi>Marcel</hi> gives for Divinatons, are not tollerable: who can vindicate <hi>Julian</hi> from this notorious Injuſtice, that to give, as he judged, a true proſpect of future Contingences, he would

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94184:49"/> him culpable of Injuſtice; that they were not in him true virtues, is evinced in the <hi>6th</hi> Quaaere.

'Tis true, a Prince ought to prefer his Honour to his Life: to live, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us to Beaſts: to live well, is peculiar to men: a Mans Life is not to be meaſured by his years, but actions; what a ſlave he was to vain-glory, the Precedent diſcourſe manifeſts.

In this declining eſtate of the Empire, a General was to be choſen: none by the Emperors Council was thought fit to command the Army, but <hi>Walleſtine;</hi> who remembring this remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from the General, ſeemingly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that great employment, politickly covering his ambitious revenge.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94184:53"/> to himſelf, not mentioning the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and to confirm them in this deſign, he gave three months pay to the Army: but the Emperor prevented him by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing <hi>Prague.</hi> Duke <hi>Pernard</hi> durſt not truſt him. <hi>Gordon, Leaſly,</hi> two Noble <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Gentlemen, and <hi>Butler,</hi> no leſs excellent an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman, inviting four of his Principal Officers to Supper, which were his greateſt confidents, the entertainment ending with the life of the Gueſts, the gallant <hi>Butler</hi> runs up to <hi>Wallestine</hi>'s Chamber, Kills the Guard, breaks open the Door, with aſtoniſhing Salutation, <hi>O Traytor to the Empire, and Emperor, art thou there!</hi> By this Surprize he makes him uncapable of Defence, unable to command his reaſon, and by his Partizan deſtroys him, and throwing his Body into the Yard of the the Court, reduced an Army of 40000 men to the obedience of the Empire. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> enviouſly charges <hi>Conſtantius</hi> with being a Coward, upon what reaſon I know not: 'Tis true, his Arms were not ſo ſucceſsful againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as he deſired. <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> called the Darling

How fatal the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> expeditions have been againſt <hi>Perſia,</hi> the fate of the illuſtrious <hi>Baſſa Ibrahim</hi> ſufficiently evidences. It's impoſſible that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſhould be juſtly accuſed of Cowardize, who was conſtantly Victorious over all the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations that invaded the Empire, deſtroyed all Rebels, continued a terror to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and always fought in the Head of his Army, and in all humane
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94184:54"/> probability had deſtroyed <hi>Julian,</hi> if Death had not prevented him. It ſeems very ſtrange, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did not ſooner diſcover <hi>Julian</hi>'s ambition: ſo true is that of St. <hi>Auguſtine, Lib. 5. Cap. 21. De civit. Dei. Qui</hi> Conſtantino <hi>Chriſtiano ipſo Juliano Apoſtatoe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He who gave the Empire to</hi> Conſtantine <hi>a Chriſtian, did likewiſe give it to Julian the Apostate, whoſe admirable parts his Sacrilegious ambition ſoiled and abuſed. Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſets ſpies upon <hi>Julian,</hi> narrowly to watch him, whether he wavered in his Religion: yet <hi>Conſtantius</hi> appointed <hi>Mardonius</hi> and <hi>Editius</hi> to teach him: and in his Journey to <hi>Epheſus</hi> he fell into the familiarity of <hi>Jamblicus</hi> and <hi>Proeretius</hi> at <hi>Athens;</hi> he was a great Admirer of <hi>Libanius,</hi> theſe inſtill'd the principles of Idolatry into him. It ſeems very ſtrange, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did not ſuſpect him; for <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was wholly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſtian Religion, and very watchful to preſerve the Dignity of it Companions may diſcover the humour of a Perſon; thoſe ſpies were certainly faithleſs: If <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had known, that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94184:54"/> he converſed with heathen Philoſophers, and thoſe that were known Magicians, certainly he would have ſuſpected him as to his Religion. His own words, and the acclamations of the People mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted that his deſign was the Empire. When he came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he received News, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had taken and ſacked <hi>Colonia Agrippinoe</hi> (now <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len)</hi> a great and well fortifyed City, which made him break out into theſe expreſſions, <hi>I ſhall dye inveſted with Honours, and encompaſſed with dangers;</hi> words that import the height of his Ambition: for what is great, that is not difficult? The people encouraged him in his journey by their acclamations. When he entred into <hi>Vienna,</hi> an Old Blind Woman, at the joyful noiſe of the People, enquired what great Perſon came into the City? it was returned, <hi>Julian Coeſar,</hi> ſhe replied, that <hi>It was he that ſhould repair the Temples of the gods.</hi> I cannot but wonder that this paſſage ſhould not be carried to the Ears of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius. Julian,</hi> when he was in his <hi>Aſian</hi> journey, convers'd the Heathen Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94184:55"/> and by them was inſtructed in the Heathen Rites, and in the myſtery of Divination, to which he was extreamly addicted. <hi>Eunapius</hi> ſaith of him, That <hi>before he was</hi> Caeſar <hi>none knew what gods he Worſhipped:</hi> he did ſecretly worſhip the Heathen gods, whilſt he publickly profeſſed Chriſtianity. Hypocriſy is a Virtue becoming an ambitious perſon; and this he practiſed ſo perfectly, that he fully impoſed upon <hi>Hilarius</hi> himſelf. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> adhered to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and was an enemy of thoſe who profeſſed the one Subſtance, amongſt which <hi>Hilarius</hi> was a great favorour of that Faith; him <hi>Conſtantius</hi> baniſhed: in vindication of himſelf he writes, and preſents an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> in which he hath theſe words: Nec levem habeo querelae meae teſtem, Religioſum <hi>Coeſarum</hi> tuum <hi>Julianum. I have no mean witneſs for the justneſs of my complaint, Religious</hi> Caeſar, <hi>your</hi> Julian <hi>will ſufficiently testify it.</hi> This <hi>Eulogium,</hi> that he was a Religious <hi>Coeſar,</hi> could not drop from the Pen of <hi>Hilary,</hi> if he had not believed <hi>Julian</hi> a Chriſtian, and a Catholick Chriſtian. I have ſhewed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94184:55"/> before, his diſſimulation; he favoured <hi>Hilarius,</hi> reſtored the Biſhops whom <hi>Conſtantius</hi> baniſhed. He had Poyſon in his perfumed Gloves, as the <hi>Stellio</hi> has various and beautiful ſpots upon its back, which it changes, yet the venom which lies in the Belly continually remains. Thus <hi>Julian,</hi> tho' he altered his inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſures, yet his dire intention to extirpate Chriſtianity continued. It ſeems no leſs ſtrange to me, that <hi>Julian</hi> being Six years <hi>Coeſar, Conſtantius</hi> did not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and timely detect the ambition of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> as he might eaſily have done. At ſome ſlight ſuſpition, he recalled <hi>Saluſtius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the conduct, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of this great Commander was the cauſe of that great ſucceſs which <hi>Coeſar</hi> enjoyed in the managing of his Army: but after his departure, the Arms of <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was very ſucceſsful. He ſent <hi>Lupici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> one of his Lieutenants in <hi>Brittain,</hi> to repel the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> who drove them into their own Country. He built Ships, and brought Corn out of <hi>Brittain</hi> into <hi>Gaul;</hi> and after <hi>Saluſtius</hi> his departure, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> of all the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> eſteemed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94184:56"/> the moſt valiant, they were moſt expert in Military Diſcipline; they were very patient in enduring the troubles and hardſhips of War: Theſe invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but he repreſſed them: they Fought in the Woods, where <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was always Victorious by the means of one <hi>Carietto</hi> a Son of the Barbarous King taken Priſoner. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> being thus broken, they ſued for peace, which <hi>Coeſar</hi> granted them, but upon condition, that they ſhould deliver up all their Captives, which they promiſed, but delivered not up all, but retained ſeveral, whom in former years they had carried Priſoners out of <hi>Gaul:</hi> to detect this fraud, <hi>Julian</hi> uſeth this fine Policy: thoſe that by Flight eſcaped, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands out of their Cities and Villages to come to him, and theſe by nearneſs of Kin, or by vicinity of cohabitation, or friendſhip, or by ſome other cauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the Name of each that remained Priſoner; theſe his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries write down, which being done, he carries his Army beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and commands the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to appear
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94184:56"/> before him, aſcends his Tribunal, his Notaries being at his Back, he demands the Captives; they ſay, <hi>that they had returned all:</hi> he diſcovered the Cheat, by acquainting them with the very names of the Perſons that remained Priſoners amongſt them: the <hi>Babarians</hi> ſuppoſing the gods had diſcovered this ſecret to <hi>Julian,</hi> confeſſed, promiſed, and performed the reſtoring every Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that was alive. <hi>Julian</hi> required pledges, <hi>viz.</hi> The Son of their King, and of the Primeſt of their Nobility: The King fell down before <hi>Julian,</hi> miſerably crying out, that he had no Son, for he was ſlain. <hi>Julian</hi> pities the King, ſhews him his Son, whom he had treated like a Prince: and having taken him, and the Sons of the Nobility for Pledges, he granted them a Peace, upon condition, that they ſhould never any more moleſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Fame of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Victories flying throughout the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the ſuſpition was greater in the Breaſt of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who ſends for two Wings of <hi>Julian</hi>'s beſt Soldiers: theſe march to <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> Afterwards he

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether there were any thing Divine in the Death of <hi>Julian?</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>TO enquire, whether in the death of <hi>Julian</hi> there was ſomething ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, is not an unbecoming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. 'Tis Superſtition to attribute eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, which appears extraordinary, to a Praeternatural Cauſe: Yet to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign all things to the uſual courſe of Nature; to neglect and deny the Hand of God, when it is ſignally manifeſt, is Impiety and Irreligion. Mortals are apt to be hurried with prejudice, byaſt with paſſion and private intereſt; to render their Enemies more odious, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly attribute their Calamities to the revenging Hand of God. To avoid theſe extreams; and to clear the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things from Paſſions, becomes a Chriſtian. I hope my proceedings ſhall vindicate my Pen from ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. I will therefore give a juſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94184:58"/> account, what the Heathens themſelves did think of <hi>Julian</hi>'s fatal blow. <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf, in his Sacrifices, had many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>Omens,</hi> which forced him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that <hi>the Gods had forſaken him.</hi> The threatning Appearances are recited in his Life: The Night before he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his mortal Wound, whilſt he was offering his Depulſatory Sacrifices to the gods, he was ſo terrifyed by the Sight of a <hi>Meteor</hi> reſembling a bright Star, that, at the firſt ſight thereof, an univerſal trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſeized on him, fear diſturbed his Judgement; he imagined it to be <hi>Mars;</hi> he conſulted his <hi>Thuſcan</hi> Southſayers, who ſhewed him out of <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Book, this Aphoriſme, <hi>That if ſuch a fiery Light was ſeen in the Sky, no Battel ought to be fought, nor any great matter attempted.</hi> He, who to a fond ſuperſtition was addicted to Divination, and adored <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> (ſuch ſort of Cattel ſwarmed in his Court and Camp) yet contrary to his menacing <hi>Omens,</hi> and the advice of his Diviners, he was hurried, by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, into his ruin, which was a certain argument of his own innate
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94184:58"/> Valour, and of the Wrath of Heaven. <hi>Ammianus Marcel</hi> His great admirer, doth aver, that from whence that fatal <hi>Javelin</hi> was thrown, God himſelf knew. <hi>Socrates</hi> relates, that <hi>Caliſtus, one of his Guard, who wrote Julian</hi>'s <hi>Life in Heroick Verſe, and gave a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Perſian War, affirms; he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being fatally Struck by ſome Doemon.</hi> That he was not wounded by any of his enemies, there is this full evidence: The news of his fall being brought to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> a Proclamation was made through his Army, That if any of his Soldiers wounded the Emperor, he ſhould be honourably rewarded: but none arrogated to himſelf that Fact, upon which in the next days Fight, the <hi>Perſians</hi> upbraided the <hi>Romans</hi> with the perfidious Treaſon of killing their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: but <hi>Marcellinus</hi> poſitively ſaith, that <hi>Javelin</hi> could not come from the Hand of a <hi>Roman:</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf, after he was brought into his Tent, in his laſt Speech to the Philoſophers, and great Commanders, bleſſed the gods, that he dyed not by Treaſon, nor the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94184:59"/> hand of a Traytor. Some good Authors aver, that after he received that mortal blow, he threw his Blood into the Air, and in a rage cryed out, <hi>Thou haſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, O</hi> Galilean; <hi>O</hi> Galilean, <hi>thou haſt overcome!</hi> When his Soldiers found him wounded, they were Struck with horror, and heard him curſe the gods; he curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Sun</hi> for aiding the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and not himſelf; he complained, that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Mars</hi> had denyed him aſſiſtance; that <hi>Apollo</hi> had been falſe in his promiſes; that thundring <hi>Jove</hi> did not prevent his fatal Wound, by caſting a Bolt upon him that threw the Dart; that inſtead of <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> and his other Tutelar and happy gods, Paleneſs, Famine and Death, thoſe unlucky Deities, were his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting attendants.

The like was that of a Holy man, who being ſcoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly asked, <hi>How was the Carpenters Son employed?</hi> returned, <hi>He is preparing a Coffin for</hi> Julian. Theſe Propheſies were confirmed by his death, which ſhortly fell out. The notice of his death by

When one was haſtning to go to <hi>Julian,</hi> who was then in <hi>Perſia,</hi> having ſeated himſelf in the high-way, by reaſon there were no conveniency in Houſes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into a Church, where he ſlept; and in his ſleep he ſaw many of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets gathered together, who greatly complained of thoſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and indignities which <hi>Julian</hi> did to the Church: they entred into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and after a long deliberation, whilſt they were in ſuſpenſe, two of them roſe up and bid the reſt be of good Courage, for they would go and put a period to <hi>Julian</hi>'s Empire. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon having received this Viſion, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his journey, expecting the end of the Viſion; and ſleeping the next night in the ſame Church, he ſaw the ſame company, and two perſons, as ſtepping out of the way, and coming to them, told them that <hi>Julian</hi> was ſlain. He adds immediately another Viſion made to <hi>Didymus</hi> a perſon in Holy-Orders, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94184:60"/> very much addicted to Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, who was mightily affected with thoſe impieties which <hi>Julian</hi> perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ruin of Chriſtian Religion; and that the Emperor ſhould be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, he betakes himſelf to Faſting and Prayer: the following night, as he ſat on his Throne, being in an extaſy, he ſaw, as it were, white Horſes running in the Air, and heard the Riders ſaying, Tell <hi>Didymus</hi> that this very hour <hi>Julian</hi> is ſlain, and let him ſignifie this to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius. Theodoret</hi> gives this account of one <hi>Julian,</hi> of the ſame name with the Apoſtate, he was a perſon that lived an aſcetick Life, and when he was Twenty days journey from his Cell to the Army, he had this Viſion, Whilſt he was praying to God, who is the great giver of aid, preſently his tears were ſtayed, he ceaſed to weep, and became of a chearful Countenance, the joy of his Soul appearing in his looks: His Confident asked him the reaſon of that Change; he returned, <hi>The wild Boar of the Foreſt, the great enemy of the Vineyard of the Lord, was dead: on
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94184:61"/> whom God had inflicted a moſt juſt puniſh-men, that he could no longer continue any deſigns againſt the Church of God:</hi> which cauſed the whole fraternity to throw themſelves into an expreſſive joy. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were certified, that the ſame day and hour, when this moſt divine and aged perſon acquainted them with the death of him who was the plague of Chriſtians, he was removed into another World. If any one Scruple theſe Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, I muſt return, Theſe Hiſtorians are not fabulous; and that though mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and viſions are not ſo frequent as they were in Apoſtolical times, yet they never ceaſed in the Church of God. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is alledged as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who affirmed that miracles were ceaſed in his time: yet I muſt aver, that thoſe authorities of his, mean only the unfrequency of them, or elſe he forgets and contradicts himſelf: in ſeveral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he confirms believers by them. I will aſſert, that the conſequence of his death gives an evident Teſtimony, that it proceeded from the Hand of God. He was indubitably, a Prince of great
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94184:61"/> Wit and undertaking. God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Wiſdom; no Prince more abuſed his natural prudence than he, by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Ships. His great intentions were to deſtroy Chriſtianity, yet he would not elect any of his great Commanders, who were Heathens, to ſuceed him in the Empire: He cloſed his laſt ſpeech to his Commanders with theſe words, <hi>I wiſh there may be found a good Ruler after me.</hi> He was ſo confident of the humor of his Army, that he having ſo model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, did not at leaſt ſuſpect that it would declare a Chriſtian Emperor. The Army proffered the Purple to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtius</hi> the Praefect. On a ſudden (a long time was not admitted for deliberation) <hi>Jovianus</hi> was choſen Emperor. Before the death of <hi>Julian;</hi> the State of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſeemed as moſt deſperate. Sweetly <hi>Nazianzen</hi> thus, <hi>Our</hi> (meaning Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) <hi>Weapons, our Walls, our Strength, was only truſt and hope in God: when we were left deſtitute, and deprived of all hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane aid, who remained to receive our Prayers, and defend us from injury, but God alone?

               <head>Qu. III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Whether there be true Miracles, or not?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Opinion, that denies Miracles, too much prevails. By a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, I underſtand that thing which is extraordinarily produced by a divine Power, it not being in the Sphere of Nature to be the cauſe of it. That has the nature of a Miracle, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a divine Power. Angels and Men have been the Inſtruments of working Miracles; but the principal cauſe was God. <hi>Hobs</hi> ſeems to aſſert Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but ſo as he does other Truths, <hi>Ficte &amp; Fucate;</hi> for his opinion of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal neceſſity is inconſiſtent with that of Miracles; withal he making the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to be the ſole Judge of Miracles, takes away all Miracles: for to aver, that a Miracle is not to be accounted a Miracle, except it have the ſuffrage of a ſupream power, is to aver, there are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94184:64"/> no miracles: therefore <hi>Sp.</hi> ſaies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, <hi>There are no miracles; for thus he pronounceth, nothing can be effected above the power of Nature, otherwiſe the courſe of nature would be deſtroyed, for all things are carried on by a fatal neceſſity: If any thing therefore as a Miracle, ſhould happen, the World would be everted.</hi> To which, I reply, that the courſe of this World is not managed by a fatal Neceſſity: for the conception of a Fatal neceſſity is contradictory to the notion of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diety: and there can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Omnipotence, and Infinite Power, but in a Being that is void of all imperfections, and includes in himſelf all Excellencies and Perfections. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Will, is without doubt one of the perfections of rational beings: If Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God could have made the World otherwiſe than it is, or men more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then they are, then there is no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Neceſſity; but God acted Arbitrarily according to the good Pleaſure of his own Will: if not, then he was not Omnipotent, nor Omniſcient: he neither knows how, nor could produce a thing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94184:64"/> better than it is: and that Being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be called Omnipotent, or Omniſcient, whoſe power and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are limited. From the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes therefore is evinced the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Miracles: and the real exiſtence of them is proved by matter of Fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Power of God, had <hi>Manna</hi> miraculouſly rained upon them, which ſuffic'd for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of 3000 men every day; and if the meaſure appointed by the Divine Wiſdom was not obſerved by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who upon an apprehenſion of a want on the Sabbath-day collected a double quantity on the day preceding, the <hi>Manna</hi> by its ſtinking would prove hurtful to the takers of it. If ſuch a thing was done, how could it be but miraculouſly? that it was done, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſand people could not but be ſufficient Teſtimonies of it. And it could not be imagined that for ſo many years, ſo many Thouſand perſons ſhould be deceived. Our Lord and Saviour roſe from the Grave, upon the Teſtimony
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94184:65"/> of which Miracle our glorious Religion does conſiſt: and his riſing from the dead by his own Power, is a moſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Teſtimony of the Truth of his Doctrine. His Apoſtles every where went abroad to Preach Salvation, only to be obtained by Faith in the Lord; and if they were aſſured of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they had ſufficient encouragement: for what could be greater? they were to paſs through the World, to Preach Religion contrary to the common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Mankind: And how could they expect a ſucceſs of their endeavours, but by the aſſurance of him that roſe from the dead, that he would conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſt them? They were ſpectators of his aſcenſion into Heaven, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them his aſſiſtance, and nothing could reſiſt him, who in the ſight of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles was carried up into Heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting of them, that all Power was given to him both in Heaven and in Earth: being thus encouraged, they went Preaching throughout the World, with that ſucceſs, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Forty years, ſome in moſt places of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94184:65"/> the world entertain'd thoſe Myſteries, and that Doctrine which brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What could induce the Apoſtles to undertake this employment? were they invited by Honours? No, they were judged the off-ſcouring of the World. Did Riches? they were Poor, or reduc'd to Poverty. Did Pleaſures? they expoſed themſelves to all dangers, ſuffered various torments, and at laſt generally underwent thoſe cruelties which crown'd them with a glorious Martyrdom. Theſe things being done, and ſuffer'd by them, for what end, but the expectation of a future happineſs? And what could make them believe that; but the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead? which tho' he foretold his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet when he was apprehended, they all forſook him, one of whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, and was made by a pitiful Maid ſo timerous and ſneaking, as to abjure him: But afterwards he, and the reſt, being eye-witneſſes of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, were ſo confident and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, that they all freely expoſed themſelves to the greateſt dangers, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94184:66"/> and death it ſelf, in the defence and propagating that great Truth. If Chriſt be riſen again, there is a Miracle: That he did Riſe again, no greater teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony can be given for the proof of any other thing than for this. Had they any Learning to perſwade the World? In what Academy were they brought up? They Preach'd the Goſpel to every Nation: How came they to know the Language of every Nation? What Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter taught them theſe various Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? That they did know them, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the ſucceſs their Preaching had in the World. This is another evidence of Chriſts Reſurrection; for they were not only eye-witneſſes of it, but receiv'd the ſignal benefit thereby. Thoſe Balls of fire, and that Earthquake, which fruſtrated <hi>Julian</hi>'s attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were miraculous. If the Narrative be true, certainly the Divine Power was exerted; and that it was true, the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of Hiſtorians, not only Chriſtians but Pagans, will perſwade us: And that <hi>Julian</hi> commanded the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94184:66"/> to be rebuilt, is evident by his own Epiſtles now extant. That the <hi>Jews</hi> would embrace this occaſion, is not to be queſtion'd: that <hi>Julian</hi> had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to accompliſh his deſign, is not to be doubted: that he could not compleat his intentions, is, without ſcruple, ſolely to be attributed to the miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. <hi>Machiavel</hi> himſelf (no great friend to Religion) obſerves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that before the deſtruction of any great Empire, or Nation, there are various Prodigies and Omens: but to what cauſe to aſſign them, he knows not. <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf, and thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers which he admir'd, and which flouriſhed in his time (which either profeſſed <hi>Platoniſm;</hi> or rather a mixture of <hi>Plato</hi>'s and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy: ſuch were <hi>Porphyrie, Jamblicus, Aedeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Maximus,</hi> &amp;c.) acknowledged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Propheſies. <hi>Julian</hi> was very much addicted to Divination, inſomuch that when he was dead, there was found in one of his Temples a Virgin hang'd up, and her Belly ript open, that by the inſpection of her Bowels, he might
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94184:67"/> diſcover future Contingencies. <hi>Euna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> relates ſome prodigious Actions perform'd by Philoſophers and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Magicians, which concludes, that there are falſe Miracles; that there are inviſible Spirits, Beings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate between God and Man, is undoubtedly true: But how they act, or what power they exert, is not certain to Mortals. That they are ſuperiour to the capacities of men, is certain; but what additional power God confers upon all Spirits, either by themſelves, or by their Inſtruments, we are not certain: Yet that actions are done through the Almighty Power of God, by the Miniſtry of good Angels and Men, ſuperiour to thoſe of evil Angels and Men, is unqueſtionable: And that thoſe Actions could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, except thoſe good Angels and Men had been acted by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er infinitely above their own capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is equally true. That there has been falſe Miracles, or pretences, is granted: If no diſguiſe, no real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94184:67"/> if no lye, no truth; if no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, no ſincerity. The very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Miracle, argues, that the whole World agreed in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there were true Miracles. The ſum of this diſcourſe is included in theſe Two particulars: 1. Whether there is a Wiſe and Infinite God, which created the World? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of which puts a Period to this Diſcourſe. That this World was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a fortuitous concourſe of Atoms, is ſo ridiculous a conceit, ſo fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick a <hi>Delirium,</hi> that no perſon of any Brains can admit. The World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created in time, atteſts the liberty of the Divine Will, and the verity of Miracles. 'Tis impoſſible to conceive that the World was eternal, for it is ſucceſive, and Eternity cannot be thought to have a <hi>prius &amp; poſterius:</hi> for mutation cannot agree with the action of a Deity: Every thing that is mutable, is imperfect: <hi>Motus eſt ab im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobili motore.</hi> The change is in the object, not agent: The firſt cauſe muſt be <hi>libra, &amp; immutabilis:</hi> Theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94184:68"/> cannot avert the courſe of Nature, but manifeſt the Power and Liberty of God: as unuſual methods in an Army do not alter the Diſcipline, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Policy and Power of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>If Chriſtianity be ſo excellent in it ſelf, how comes it to paſs, that vertuous Heathens ſhould ſo direfully perſecute the Profeſſors of it?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT may poſſibly be queried, If Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity hath a real excellency in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What ſhould be the reaſon, that ſuch vertuous Princes as <hi>Trajan, Severus,</hi> and ſome others, extreamly deteſted it? that <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Commodus,</hi> who were Beaſts, or Devils in the ſhape of Men, ſhould hate it, is no wonder, but that ſuch a perſon as <hi>Trajan</hi> was a deadly hater of Chriſtians, and he had gained ſo great an eſteem for his vertues, that in the acclamations of the People to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, theſe words were uſed, <hi>Sis Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto Felicior Trajano melior:</hi> by which they ſignified, No Proſperity could be ſuperiour to that of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that of <hi>Trajan:</hi> Therefore it muſt needs be judged, that Chriſtians
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94184:69"/> were eſteemed rather Monſters than Men. <hi>Suetonius</hi> calls Chriſtians, <hi>a ſort of men of a new and miſchievous Superſtition. Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſtians, for their impiety, were hated by the People.</hi> This does not derogate from, but advance the Glory of Chriſtianity. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Chriſtians were deadly haters of Idolatry, and deriders of thoſe gods, whom the Heathens adored: It cannot therefore be wondered at, that thoſe perſons, who conceived a real and true divinity of their gods, ſhould with the greateſt fury perſecute thoſe that deride them, and eſteem them impious and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical. Princes do moſt hate theſe two Crimes, Treaſon and Sacriledge; this is the greateſt, next to which is <hi>Loeſa Majeſtas.</hi> On this account thoſe Oracles of the Law, ſuch were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, &amp;c.</hi> were vehement perſecutors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the firſt Ages of the Church, many Heathens looked upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as <hi>Jews,</hi> and by the name of <hi>Jews</hi> Chriſtians were ſignified. The Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Edicts, which were made to expel
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94184:69"/> the <hi>Jews,</hi> compriſed the Chriſtians; for the firſt Chriſtians were <hi>Jews.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans came from <hi>Judea,</hi> and many of the <hi>Jews</hi> were really Chriſtians: both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians were deadly haters of Idolatry, which made them hated by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who did not at firſt make the juſt deſtinction between Chriſtians and <hi>Jews,</hi> as ought to have been made. <hi>Dio</hi> therefore relating of <hi>Flavius Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Flavia Domatilla</hi> his Wife, aſſigns the cauſe of their death; <hi>they were,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>condemned to dye for Atheiſm for turning</hi> Jews, <hi>but theſe were really Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and dyed in the defence of the Faith of the Lord Jeſus, which Faith cauſing as equal an hatred of the Pagan Idolatry, as the Jewiſh Religion did, this Pagan Hiſtorian accuſes them of Atheiſme and Judaiſme.</hi> The hatred againſt Chriſtians muſt be the greater, by reaſon they were thought Chriſtian <hi>Jews.</hi> The generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> was curſed of God, becauſe they believed not on the Lord of Glory, whom they crucified, and hated. They were Seditious, and tumultuous, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94184:70"/> their wicked Rebellion againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and thoſe moſt dreadful acts perpetrated amongſt themſelves du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Seige at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> rendred them odious to the Empire, and to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This deadly hatred being conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Chriſtians, it cannot be thought, but that all imaginable Arts, and all falſe rumours were preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and entertained againſt them by prejudiced perſons. A Fame flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that <hi>in the private meetings of Chriſtians, all laſcivious wickedneſs, and clancular impurities were committed; and that in their aſſemblies they did eat young Children.</hi> Innocency can hardly be cleared before thoſe Judges who are prepoſſeſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And there were ſome pretended Chriſtians that were the ſcandal of the Croſs of Chriſt, that though they carried the Name of Chriſtians, were really An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians, which were guilty of moſt dreadful impurity, and horrid Villanies. This ſeemingly gave an occaſion for Heathens to perſiſt in their ill opinions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94184:70"/> of Chriſtians: and what wickedneſs was acted by ſome pretenders, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the whole Body of Chriſtians. All theſe, in truth, did advance Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and make it more admirable in the eſteem of Wiſe and Sober perſons; for if the Opinion of the Heathen Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was the cauſe of the Perſecutions of Chriſtians, then the diſpute is truly this, Whether the impure Pagan gods were rather to be worſhipped, than the true and only God, the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? In which it may eaſily be determin'd, That thoſe impure perſons, who pretended themſelves Chriſtians, and by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence gave a ſcandal to a moſt glorious Religion, when they were Challenged for their Faith, denied it, according to the moſt vertuous principles of Mr. <hi>Hobs.</hi> An Action of the Body, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Conſcience, being internal, is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How is it poſſible with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to condemn Chriſtianity? Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Laws of the Lord Jeſus, can there be any more reaſonable, or pious? If
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94184:71"/> ſeveral perſons of that perſwaſion have different lives, that cannot prejudice the truth, and excellency of Religion. <hi>Let God be true, and all Men Lyars.</hi> That Multitudes of Chriſtians lived accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of their Lord, <hi>Trajan</hi> gives an evident Teſtimony; for he would frequently pronounce, that none ſuffered ſo much for their God, as Chriſtians did. And <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> his Proconſul in <hi>Aſia</hi> (aſtoniſhed at the multitude of Chriſtians, who voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyed in the Profeſſion of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) writes to <hi>Trajan,</hi> and acquaints him, That the genuine Chriſtians would for no Torments deny Chriſt; that he could not find them guilty of any Crime; that they met before day, and in their Conventions bound themſelves in an Oath, not to commit any evil Act, ſuch as Theft, Murder, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which advances Chriſtianity. He commands them to abſtain from all private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by the Law of the Twelve Tables, all ſuch Conventions were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. No wonder then, that <hi>Trajan</hi> was ſevere againſt the Chriſtians, for he was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94184:71"/> extreamly ſuperſtitious, and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to Idolatry, and withal vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for although he was in outward appearance juſt; and certainly Valiant, and endued with many excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, yet theſe he ſullied by his enmity to Chriſtianity; the Principal vertue of man being Religion. Of his intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Sodomy, <hi>Dio</hi> accuſes him. <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf in his Satyrical reflections upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, <hi>When Trajan was admitted into Heaven,</hi> Silenus <hi>whiſpers</hi> Jupiter <hi>in the ear, that he ought to take great care of Ganymedes. Pliny</hi>'s reſcript to <hi>Trajan</hi> ſo influenced him, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no ſearch to be made for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; but if any Chriſtians were brought before him, they ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: Upon which <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath this excellent remark: <hi>He commands the Chriſtians not to be ſearched for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew them innocent; and yet he commands them to be puniſhed, as though they were nocent: at the ſame time, when he pretends Mercy, he exerciſes Cruelty: when he is extreamly ſevere, he puts on the Vizor of Clemency.</hi> In the laſt year of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94184:72"/> his Empire (as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> after him) he (finding by experience, that Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not be eradicated by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) iſſued a Command to his Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Prefects, to put a period to them. To the Honour of Chriſtianity, it may well be conſidered, that the Swords of Perſecutors were drawn againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; there were vaſt diviſions amongſt themſelves, and the Schools of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were open againſt them. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperor had his Line ended in <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate. The Poſterity of Holy <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of him Chriſt muſt come according to the Fleſh: But to manifeſt to the World, that the Glory of Chriſtianity depended not upon Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, or a Secular Sword, the Poſterity of the great <hi>Constantine</hi> did not long continue.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians were likewiſe rendred odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by inſinuations; that they were Enemies to the Empire. To make them deteſtable, the people were perſwaded, that they were Atheiſts, Rebels, and moſt wicked perſons; and therefore, if
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94184:72"/> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was diſturbed by the Arms of Barbarians, waſted by Plagues, or that Fires laid Cities in Aſhes; if a Famine was cauſed by Drought, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, then, <hi>Chriſtiani ad Leones,</hi> their Impieties were the cauſe of all the Evils that befell the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>Theſe were grand miſtakes; they were men of the moſt holy Lives, moſt abſtemious, and greateſt contemners of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his incomparable Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. ſpeaking of Chriſtians, <hi>Their Kindred, their Manſions, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, their Eſteem, their Dignity were only in Heaven.</hi> One thing, with a briskneſs, he requeſts, That through the ignorance of its cauſe it may not be contemn'd, whilſt perſons are ignorant of it; and ſo truly aſſerts, That <hi>the firſt cauſe of the hatred conceived againſt the Chriſtian Name, was their not knowing the Faith and Manners of Chriſtians, which is made perſpicuous by the effect the Apologies made for Chriſtians had upon ſome Emperors, who raiſed a Perſecution againſt them. Adrian</hi> the Emperor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94184:73"/> a ſevere Perſecution. <hi>Severianus Granianus,</hi> Proconſul of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Writes to <hi>Adrianus</hi> an Epiſtle in the behalf of the Chriſtians, and acquaints him, That <hi>its moſt unjuſt, that upon the clamour of the multitude, the Blood of the moſt innocent perſons in the World ſhould be ſhed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> at the Reading of which, writes an Epiſtle to <hi>Minutius Fundanus,</hi> whom he ſubſtitutes in the Room of <hi>Severia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Granianus, Commanding that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould be puniſhed, except he was a Criminal; and that if any did accuſe a Chriſtian of any crime, if he could not prove it, he ſhould ſuffer that ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he deſign'd to have inflicted upon Chriſtians.</hi> When <hi>Adrian</hi> was at <hi>Athens,</hi> to behold the ſacred <hi>Eluſinian</hi> Rites, then <hi>Quadratus</hi> Biſhop thereof, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtides</hi> a Chriſtian Philoſopher, did write Apologies for the Chriſtians, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Emperor with them. <hi>Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> upon the ſame Subject pronounces an Oration before him, which aſſwaged <hi>Adrians</hi> anger conceiv'd againſt the Chriſtians; <hi>They were ſo far from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any thing upon the Empire, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94184:73"/> in their holy Conventions they prayed for the long Life of their Emperors, for the Peace of the Commonwealth, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire may flouriſh by a wiſe and faithful Senate, valiant and victorious Armies. Tho' many of the Emperors were traiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſlain, yet no Chriſtians dide their Swords in Imperial Blood: Tho' many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, yet no Chriſtians ever engaged in any.</hi> Hence <hi>Tertullian, ad Scapulum,</hi> Cap. 2. <hi>Circa majeſtatem imperatoris in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famamur, nunquam Albiniani, nec Nigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani, vel Caſſiani inveniri potuiſſent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiani; A Chriſtian is enemy of no perſon, much leſs of the Emperor, knowing him, to be conſtituted by Almighty God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We give that Worſhip and Honour to the Emperor, as far as 'tis lawful for us; and expedient; for he is a Man infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to God, and whatſoever honour he hath, he hath it from God, unto whom he is only inferior. <hi>Domitian</hi> moved the ſecond Perſecution, of which, out of <hi>Egeſippus Euſebius</hi> thus, <hi>Being under the ſame fears of Chriſt, as</hi> Herod <hi>was, perſecuted the Family of</hi> David: <hi>There were remaining of that Line, which were
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94184:74"/> the Grandchildren of</hi> Judas, <hi>near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according to the Fleſh, of our Lord and Saviour; Theſe, one</hi> Jovianus <hi>brought before</hi> Domitian, <hi>who asked them whether they were allyed to</hi> David? <hi>they confeſſed. Then he enquired of them what Eſtate they had and of what Calling? They anſwered, by calling they were Husbandmen; and their Eſtate was not in Money, but in their Farms. He then demanded of them who Chriſt was, of what nature was his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in what part of the World, and at what time it ſhould be erected? To which they reply'd, that the Kingdom of Chriſt was not Terreſtrial or Mundane, but Heavenly and Angelical, the viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of which will be at the end of the World, when the Lord with great Glory and Majeſty ſhall deſcend from Heaven, and ſhall paſs a ſentence upon both the quick and the dead, and reward every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works: upon which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed them as contemptible perſons, and ſtaid the Perſecutions. Tertullian</hi> ſaith the ſame. <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> quench'd the Fire of thoſe Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:94184:74"/>
               <p>No finer way to render Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion odious to Princes, than to prove, that the Profeſſors of it were Rebels to their Princes: Let the Principles of Chriſtian Riligion be conſidered, and the Practiſes of the Primitive Chriſtians, and the contrary will manifeſtly appear. Thus, 'tis fully clear'd, that no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can poſſibly be given, to vindicate the Emperors that perſecuted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The Courtiers of <hi>Darius,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> being emulous of that honour which <hi>Daniel</hi> recieved from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; Two things, to take away his Life, they propos'd; the one was the affairs of the Crown: they endeavour'd to charge him with Treaſon, but no error, nor fault was found in him. The ſame is verified of the Chriſtians in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times. Then they ſaid, <hi>We ſhall find no fault in him, but concerning the Law of his God,</hi> Dan. 6. 4, 5. He that was faithful to his King, was ſo likewiſe to his God: for which ſlighting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Praying to his God, he was thrown into the Lions Den, but miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerv'd; which occaſion'd <hi>Darius,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:94184:75"/> to decree, that Honour and Fear ſhould be given to the God of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians could not be juſtly charged with Rebellion; they were reproved for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge and Atheiſme (1.) for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God: in the performance of which they continuing, were expos'd to Lyons, and all manner of calamities; but Religion was maintain'd, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; and the great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> put a period to thoſe Perſecutions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the God and Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be worſhip'd and ador'd.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THere is a late Author; who has put out a Pamphlet, ſtil'd, <hi>Some ſeaſonable Remarks upon the deplorable Fall of the Emperor</hi> Julian. In which he chargeth Chriſtian Religion it ſelf, the beſt of the Chriſtian Emperors, and peculiarly the chiefeſt of the Chriſtian Clergy, as the Cauſes of it.</p>
                  <p>To give a full return to this Queſtion, <hi>How comes it to paſs, that Virtuous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens perſecute Chriſtians?</hi> 'Tis neceſſary, that Chriſtianity, and the Chriſtian Clergy be vindicated from thoſe aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons caſt upon both by this Author. If what he ſays be true, <hi>Julian</hi>'s dreadful Perſecution might receive ſome tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We will examine the calumnies caſt upon the Chriſtian Emperors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Slanders with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Chriſtian Clergy. And,</p>

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:94184:76"/>3. The Abuſes which he puts upon Religion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>1. Pag. 2. <hi>To relinquiſh a Religion of ſo much genuine piety, and ſimple innocence as ours is, for the fond ſuperſtitions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and groſs Idolaters, would be not only unaccountable, but above meaſure ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious; Did we not find the lamentable cauſes in the debaucht Chriſtianity of thoſe times: I mean, the times of the two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> Conſtantine <hi>and</hi> Conſtantius.</p>
                  <p>I will acknowledge, that there was a defection in the Lives of many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> fell into <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> is very much to be deplored: of his Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions he repented before he dyed. He was ſo far from being debauch'd, that he was one of the moſt temperate men in the world; and ſo far from being an hypocrite, that tho' he can't be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting that Haereſy, yet he is mightily to be commended for his hatred of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and his zeal in promoting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. In that bloody Battel in which he fought with <hi>Magnenſius</hi> at <hi>Murſum,</hi> he threw out of his Army all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94184:76"/> Soldiers that would not be Baptized, to ſhew, that his Victory ſhould depend only upon Chriſt his Saviour. As for <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> he was the Pattern of all virtues: to ſay, <hi>They</hi> (meaning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) <hi>having got ambitious and diſſolute Princes of their Party;</hi> 'tis a moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and falſe calumny, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Pen of any that would be eſteemed a Gentleman. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was a Prince of as great accompliſhments as ever ſwayed the <hi>Roman</hi> Scepter. 'Tis acknowledged, that <hi>Julian</hi> doth traduce this great <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Which of the Emperors did he ſpare? Which of them in the perſon of <hi>Silenus</hi> does he not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe? He drolls upon every one but himſelf. In the Lives of the <hi>Coeſars,</hi> he feigns that <hi>Alexander</hi> went to <hi>Hercules;</hi> and that <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> being unlike to all the gods, ſhould fly into the Arms of the Goddeſs of Pleaſure. This is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reflection; he leſſens the Victories of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> tho' his plea for himſelf was juſt, his Martial Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts confirms it. 'Tis true, he took not the Actions of falſe and impure
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94184:77"/> gods to be his Pattern; but the Copy, by which that great Prince drew his Life, was the Life and Precepts of the Holy Jeſus, the God bleſſed for evermore: No wonder he could not aſſociate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with thoſe gods, whoſe Temples he demoliſhed, and Worſhip he abhor'd. That <hi>Julian</hi> ſhould accuſe him of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, 'tis ſtrange: From his Cradle he was a Soldier: His invincible Courage, and Military Conduct was a certain Argument that he was not Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous. Let <hi>Julian</hi> endeavour to cloud his fame, yet it may eaſily be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that his Victories challenged as many Triumphant Arches, as ever <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Coeſar</hi> could demand. For many incomparable Virtues, peculiarly for that Holy Religion he profeſſed, he was ſuperiour to any preceding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. Why does this Author ſtile theſe two Emperors Ambitious? What, Did they aſpire to their own Purples? <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> coming to his Father <hi>Conſtantius Clorus</hi> before he dyed, was declared by him <hi>Coeſar:</hi> and upon his Death received the acclamations of the Army. By his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94184:77"/> juſt and victorious Arms, having ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Two Tyrants, the God of Heaven gave him the Eagles and the entire Command of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Where was <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Ambition? His Father left him the Empire of the Eaſt; and by a lawful ſucceſſion, upon the death of his Brothers, became Head of the whole Empire. Was <hi>Julian</hi> free from Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Conſtantius</hi> created him <hi>Coeſar,</hi> and he contrary to his Loyalty; Faith and Gratitude, uſurped the Imperial Dignity. Certainly he was one of the moſt ambitious and vain-glorious men in the World: After he had made ſport with all the preceding Emperors; he concludes that drolling Tract with this encomium of himſelf, Mercury <hi>directing himſelf to me, thus ſaith, I have made thee to acknowledge</hi> Apollo <hi>thy Father, whoſe commands obey: make him, whilſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, thy ſecure refuge; and when 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that thou departeſt out of this Life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with a good hope under the propitious conduct of that god.</hi> How this was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, the death of <hi>Julian</hi> doth declare.</p>
                  <p>The then Clergy he dreadfully loads
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94184:78"/> with unjuſt imputations of Ambition, Hypocriſy and Sedition. 1. Ambition.</p>

'Tis true that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> diſcountenanced Idolatry, and did demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh many Heathen Temples. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, Commanded that all Idol Temples ſhould be ſhut, that an acceſs for any perſon ſhould be prohibited.

                  <p>Pag. 17. <hi>Nothing ſo much offended him, as the vile Hipocriſy of the then Clergy, who beſides their coyning of contrary Creeds in the Reigns of</hi> Conſtantine <hi>and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, <hi>and modelling Religion by Court Intrigues, ſeemed almoſt wholly to diſpence with morality, placing Sanctimony, not ſo much in a good life, as in the ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Rituals, and the Symbolical Repreſentations of our Religion, ſuch as Baptiſme, the Euchariſt, Chriſm, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all in ſubmitting to the formalities of Confeſſion and Pennance, upon which the worſt of Offences were too eaſily remitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where was the Hypocriſy? there were two contrary Faiths, one in the

                  <p>Pag. 15. <hi>Let a Chriſtian be never ſo deeply Criminal, no profane hand muſt touch him, nor muſt he endure any other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than Confeſſion and Pennance; and that when once abſolved, he was an Innocent, as the unborn Child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How ſevere the Penitential Canons were in thoſe times, is ſufficiently known: This is according to the Law of Chriſt; and therefore what he ſaith, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy modelling Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis a moſt notorious untruth: If ever in any Age, in the fourth and fifth Centuries, the Clergy was moſt conſpicuous for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Holineſs of Life: they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94184:82"/> upon a man as penitent and contrite when he had a great ſorrow for ſin, and teſtified it by acts of ſhame and mortification, and by a future Holineſs. Certainly this Gentleman did not read, or at leaſt not ſeriouſly, the Fathers and Councils of thoſe times: it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by all, That no pardon without repentance, and no repentance without true Holineſs: To aver, as he doth, That the Eccleſiaſtical Canons being ſatisfied, no Civil puniſhment was, or could be inflicted, is a notorious falſity, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Body of the Law, and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Church and Civil Magiſtrate in all Ages. 'Tis true, Chriſtianity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the moſt vicious perſons, and the greateſt Malefactors may repent; but it does not make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to conſiſt in the ſubmiſſion to ſome exterior Rites, as <hi>Julian</hi> invidiouſly jeers; but in an hearty ſorrow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al change of the mind, which auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and mortification are a ſign of, and promote. To make theſe reflections upon Chriſtianity, from the Pen of a drolling Apoſtate, is not becoming one that is a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94184:82"/> Scholar, or a Chriſtian; That they who lived in the ſtricteſt Converſation, and contemned the World, and expoſed themſelves to all Perſecutions, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, even to the moſt Tormenting and Shameful Death, for their Lord and Maſter, ſhould think that their Religion conſiſted in Rituals, is a thing eſtranged from the Breaſts of Chriſtians. As the Calumnies, with which the Chriſtians were loaded by the Heathens for promiſcuous embraces, Sacrificing of Children in their Holy Conventions, and eating them, with other enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were abominable Untruths. 'Tis granted that Chriſtians did ſay, that Faith was required; but it was a moſt unjuſt jeer to ſay, <hi>I believe,</hi> ſuffices to make a good Chriſtian; for Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſaith, <hi>Faith without works is dead:</hi> 'Tis acknowledged, that Baptiſm was enjoyned, but not that it is a meer Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: 'Tis a Sacrament to confer grace: if a perſon did not retain that grace, he ceaſed to be a Chriſtian: when therefore the Heathens jeered Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with the <gap reason="foreign">

And as for Penance, it was neceſſary, that perſons, who after Baptiſm had relapſed into Scandalous Sins, ſhould fall under the Cenſures of the Church, and recover themſelves by repentance, which is being really ſorrowful for their Sins; which ſorrow muſt aſſert its ſelf in actions of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and revenge upon themſelves, and in an hatred of Sin, and amendment of their Lives.

                  <p>To manifeſt the falſity of theſe things, I will give this Narrative. His Father <hi>Conſtantius</hi> aſpiring to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was ſlain by the Populacy: he dyed juſtly for Treaſon. <hi>Ablavius,</hi> one meanly born, paying devout viſits to the Bones of dead Fryers, calling them holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques: In that age there was given no Honour to the Reliques of any but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94184:84"/> Martyrs, whom he calls (invidiouſly) dead Fryers. But he that advanced to great dignities and riches under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great, was ſlain by the command of <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> He married his Daughter to <hi>Conſtans: Conſtantinus Junior</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans</hi> his Soldiers: he claiming and invading thoſe places under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Conſtans,</hi> which belonged not to him. <hi>Conſtans</hi> was ſlain by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Magnenſius,</hi> who himſelf was a Chriſtian, and Commander of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Legions, the Emperors Life-Guard: During the time of the firſt Ten Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, no one Chriſtian Soldier could ever be found, that embrued his hands in the Blood of an Heathen Emperor; but now a Chriſtian Emperor is aſſaulted and murthered by Chriſtian Soldiers. <hi>Conſtans</hi> thought himſelf ſafe, when his Life-guard were Chriſtians, under the command of a Chriſtian; his hopes were in vain: but this <hi>Magnenſius</hi> was rather in ſhew and pretence, than really a Chriſtian. <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> before that great battel at <hi>Murſum,</hi> diſmiſſed thoſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94184:84"/> Soldiers which would not be Baptized. <hi>Magnenſius</hi> opened Idolatrous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and permitted Sacrifices to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. This <hi>Magnenſius</hi> cauſed after the death of <hi>Conſtans, Eutropia,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> and <hi>Nepotianus</hi> her Son, to be put to death. How can this be thrown upon the Chriſtian Religion, or the Chriſtian Clergy? or did any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Biſhop advance the names of thoſe that murthered thoſe ſo near of kin to <hi>Julian?</hi> His Authors are not cited: He avers, that upon the perſwaſion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius, Conſtans</hi> took Arms againſt <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> in which there is this double miſtake. <hi>1ſt. Conſtans</hi> never raiſed an Army againſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Brother. <hi>2dly.</hi> Nor ever did <hi>Athanaſius</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to ſuch an Action; and this <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did recal <hi>Athanaſius</hi> from his Baniſhment when he was dying.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94184:85"/> theſe words, that <hi>Athanaſius was outed of his See, as ſome ſay, for Treaſon, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery and Murther, is a paſſage not becoming a Sober Man</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> were dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful haters of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> they, out of a moſt implacable malice and rage, accuſed him of thoſe Crimes; but how clearly he vindicates himſelf, is fully known to thoſe who are vers'd in Hiſtory: the Emperor himſelf after he heard his defence, vindicated him. How Witneſſes were ſuborned to ſwear againſt him, is clearly related by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtorians: a ſhame for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to give any credence or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to thoſe Accuſations of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who for ſanctity of Life was one of the Mirrors of the World: of whom <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> ſaith well; <hi>If I ſhould praiſe</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius, <hi>I ſhould praiſe Virtue its ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>Another Reaſon he aſſigns of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, <hi>his paying devout viſits to the bones of dead Fryars, calling them Holy Reliques.</hi> In that age there was given no honour to the Reliques of any but Martyrs; thoſe he (invidiouſly) calls dead Fryars; but he that fell to Pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,

                  <p>In no part of <hi>Julian</hi>'s works, nor in this Epiſtle, is found one word aſſigning the Cauſes by him mentioned to be the true reaſon of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Apoſtacy.

Whereupon <hi>Titus</hi> wrote a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94184:86"/> Letter to <hi>Julian</hi> to vindicate himſelf and his Clergy; and aſſures <hi>Julian,</hi> that the Chriſtians and <hi>Greeks</hi> had a mutual and peaceable Converſation, and that there was nothing Seditious in the City; and that he was ſo far from being the cauſer of any tumults, that he perſuaded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all unity and concord. <hi>Julian</hi> was offended at this, to ſee the cauſe by him declared mere pretext; he wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Boſtrians,</hi> urging from this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a juſter cauſe for the Baniſhment of <hi>Titus</hi> and his Clergy: To incenſe the people, he objects againſt him, that he arrogates to himſelf the honour of being the cauſe of the <hi>Boſtreans</hi> quietneſs. <hi>I have therefore ſpecified in this my Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the words the Biſhop had the face to inſert in his Defence; Though the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſaith he, were not inferior to the</hi> Greeks <hi>in number yet I did my beſt to pacify them; theſe are your Biſhops very words of you: Mark, I pray you, how he imputes your qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs to himſelf, not to you.

                  <p>The Apoſtate endeavoured by all fine methods to palliate his cruelties, and to throw a ſcorn upon <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upbraids them with ingratitude to him, that he who had granted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians greater Liberty and Peace, than <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had done, yet that thoſe they called the Clergy, continued Seditious. In the former diſcourſe we have waſhed away that Paint, and have manifeſted, that whatſoever kindneſs he pretended to ſhew to the Chriſtians, he politickly did it for to make a fairer way to ruin them; there was no perſon of more implacable enmity to Chriſtians than <hi>Julian</hi> was: If he could raiſe the hatred and animoſity of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Paſtors, his deſign was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. What Army can maintain its Military Diſcipline without its Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers? what Church her Religious Rites and Unity without her Paſtors? This therefore he mainly propoſed to himſelf as a certain means to ruin Chriſtianity; if he could ſeparate the Chriſtians from their Biſhops and Clergy. What crime was <hi>Titus</hi> guilty of? <hi>He did ſay, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94184:87"/> the Chriſtians in</hi> Boſtra <hi>were numerous, yet they were peaceable, and that by his means, (1.) he did exhort them in his Sermons, and example them to peace and unity.</hi> But is this therefore to charge him with Sedition, and to render this fair comportment of <hi>Titus,</hi> to be the reaſon of incenſing the people againſt him? He perſwaded them to Unity; but does this argue that the <hi>Boſtrean</hi> Chriſtians had no Inclination to Peace by their own diſpoſitions? No: what Chriſtianity commanded them, he more firmly inculcates. 'Tis clearer than the day, that he takes all occaſions to the deſtruction of Chriſtianity, and therefore pitifully urges the quiet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Titus,</hi> to inſtigate the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to Baniſh him, which they did. He pretends, that in his time many who ſuffered exile, perſecution, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, were called home, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Liberty; but he always continued his ſeverity againſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> he ſaith thus, <hi>We have permitted a return to the</hi> Galileans <hi>into their Country, but not to the poſſeſſion of your Churches: I hear</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:94184:87"/> Athanaſius <hi>an impudent Fellow, elated with his wonted arrogance, has again uſurped his Epiſcopal See; wherefore upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of theſe Letters, we command to depart the City, or elſe to let him know, that more ſevere puniſhments ſhall be inflicted upon him.</hi> He ſeemed to gratify the Chriſtians but to ruin them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. What I have ſaid before, renders it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to make any further reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his Letter: 'tis granted, that he accuſes the Clergy of Sedition, that he criminates Chriſtianity; But is it excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Chriſtian to uſe the ſcandalous and jeering Defamations which an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate uſeth againſt Chriſtians and their Clergy, to render them odious? Muſt an Enemy be believed? Muſt the Arms of <hi>Philiſtines</hi> be employed to deſtroy the Temple of God? had this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man no better Teſtimonies, than what came from the Scurrilous pen of <hi>Julian?</hi> what Law, but invalids, or at leaſt leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the witneſs of a ſworn enemy? and muſt the Invectives of <hi>Julian</hi> be embraced as ſure Arguments, to ſully the Honour of the Church of God?
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94184:88"/> which is a clear refutation of that Tract, and is the Glory of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, That the Teſtimony of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are produced againſt it; which Enemies themſelves have given a real Commendation of it; when that <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius,</hi> propoſes to the Arch Prieſt of <hi>Galatia,</hi> the Examples and Carriage of Chriſtians to be imitated by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, by that means to render <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm</hi> its ſelf more amiable.</p>

                  <p>IT ſeems indubitable, that a Lawful Heir, by a Lawful Authority, upon a Lawful Reaſon, may be ſecluded from his Inheritance. The Lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>England,</hi> is, His Sacred Majeſty and the Two Houſes of Parliament: To them the Lawful Reaſon muſt be referr'd: But there is a vaſt difference 'twixt the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Laws; the Succeſſion to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Eagles. It is known in our Land, that nothing has the force of a Law, but what is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the King and Two Houſes of Parliament. His Sacred Majeſty, to give eaſe to his People, and to appeaſe the angry humours of the Diſſenters, iſſued out a Declaration for an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The Parliament upon the next Convention queſtioned this Act; His Majeſty in his Speech to them averr'd,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94184:89"/> that <hi>He would stand to his Action.</hi> They addreſt themſelves to the King: the King return'd, that <hi>they invaded his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:</hi> They reply'd, That <hi>there was never put an Inſtance of the like Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> It's otherwiſe in the Imperial Laws: <hi>Quod Principi placui<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Legis habet vigorem: What pleaſed the Emperor was a Law.</hi> The Reaſon is thus given; for by the Kingly Law, which was Enacted concerning the Empire, the people did grant unto the Emperor, and transfer upon him all their Dominion and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that, whatſoever therefore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror did by his Letters command, or in his own Perſon Decree, or by any Preſcript enjoyn, it was manifeſt, was a Law: and Juſt. <hi>Titulo 2do Sect. ſed &amp; quod,</hi> the ſame is found, <hi>C. lib. 1. Tit. 17. Sect. 7. Cum enim Lege antiqua, que Regia nuncupabatur,</hi> &amp;c. When by the Ancient Law, which was called the Royal, all the Right, and all the Power, with which the <hi>Roman</hi> people were inveſted, was transfer'd upon the Emperor; we will not therefore divide the Laws, according to the names of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94184:89"/> thoſe that Enacted them, we will have the whole Code to be our own: For how can Antiquity abrogate our Laws, which fully evinceth, that all right was ſeated in every Emperor? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Juſtinian</hi> intending to reform, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and reduce the former Laws into one Code, he would have that call'd his own. It was once in the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> people to chuſe their Magiſtrates, the created Conſuls and Dictators; but they transferring all their Power upon one ſingle Perſon; it was in the breaſt of that perſon to enact all Laws, and to conſtitute what Officers he pleaſed, and his Succeſſors: And therefore nothing more frequent in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, than the Examples of Emperors, by their own Decree, making Laws, creating <hi>Coeſars,</hi> and deſigning the ſucceſſive Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which is otherwiſe in <hi>England.</hi> The manner of Succeſſion is determined by the Laws made by the Authority of the King and the Two Houſes. And 'tis obſervable in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, that all the power being thus devolv'd upon the Emperor, whoſoever gain'd the Empire,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94184:90"/> enjoy'd the ſame power: And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Emperors were created fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the Military ſuffrage. It ſeems a great error therefore in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, from the Example of <hi>Julian,</hi> to meddle with the Engliſh Succeſſion: 'tis to be acknowledged, that <hi>Julian,</hi> by reaſon of the Barrenneſs of <hi>Euſebia, Conſtantius</hi>'s Empreſs, and that his two Brothers dyed leaving no Heir, <hi>Gallus</hi> being likewiſe cut off, was the next Heir to <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> but that title had been invalid, if <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him <hi>Coeſar. Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Eumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Pagan Orator did ſay, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine came to the Empire by the Law of Nature, and a Paternal right:</hi> But that was Oratory, and alluſive to the general uſage of Kingdoms, where the Son ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Father; but 'tis not ſo in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus</hi> was but a <hi>Coeſar</hi> under <hi>Maximianus Herculeus</hi> the Emperor; How could <hi>Conſtantine</hi> be by a Paternal right <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when his Father was but <hi>Coeſar?</hi> But his Father having influenc'd the Army, they, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Death of his Father, unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94184:90"/> ſaluted him Emperor: And <hi>Julian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>Coeſar</hi> by <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> he gain'd the affection of his Army; who after ſeveral Victories got over the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Almans,</hi> the Army ſaluted him <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> to which he had no other title; but what the Sword gave him; and by his Rebellion againſt <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> did by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws forfeit all his right and title. It appears an extravagancy to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate <hi>Julian</hi>'s Succeſſion, to the Succeſſion of the Engliſh Crown.</p>
                  <p>The actions and behaviour of the Chriſtians towards <hi>Julian,</hi> do not at all interfere with a paſſive obedience. The Queſtion is thus ſtated, Whether a Prince inveſted with Dominion may, in matters of Religion, be reſiſted by Arms? No Chriſtian did, during the Perſecution, ever take up Arms againſt the Emperor, or make the leaſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: their Paſſive Obedience was their glory, and their Blood watered the Church of Chriſt. But he rejoyns, that <hi>the Chriſtians profeſſed a Doctrine contrary to the Laws of the Empire, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Paſſive Obedience was neceſſary: But
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94184:91"/> where Religion is the Law of the Country, there it may be defended by the Sword.</hi> Hence the Army under <hi>Julian</hi> would, if they had power, have reſiſted by Arms, becauſe they profeſſed that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which became the Religion of the Empire, and was ratified by the Laws for Fifty years: But here certainly is a grand miſtake, <hi>Quod Regi placuit, legis habet vigorem,</hi> and tho' <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> by their Edicts favouring Chriſtianity, that Religion was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Empire while their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities remain'd: But <hi>Julian,</hi> a Pagan, ſucceeding, he by his Edicts reviving Idolatry, it was made the Religion of the Empire: And therefore 'twas as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for the Chriſtians under <hi>Julian</hi> to reſiſt him by the Sword, as it was for the Chriſtians under the Heathen Emperors to reſiſt them. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in our Engliſh Conſtitutions: King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, in his Parliament, eſtabliſhed the Proteſtant Religion, whereby that became the Religion of the Country. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> a Papiſt ſucceeding, gains a Parliament that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94184:91"/> the Proteſtant, and eſtabliſhes the Popiſh Doctrine: then Popery became the Religion of the Country; and no Proteſtant during her Reign did oppoſe her Perſon or Authority. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> were great inſtruments to ſet the Crown upon her Head, ſome of whom afterwards pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endur'd the Flames, and none drew a Sword; nor after her Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was any violent means uſed againſt her: by which the Authors <hi>2d Ch.</hi> is referred to the judgement of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Reader. The Chriſtians could not poſſibly think that <hi>Julian,</hi> tho' created <hi>Coeſar,</hi> had a right to the Imperial Crown, eſpecially when they ſaw he had forfeited any Paternal right by his Rebellion. The Pathetick, and almoſt inimitable eloquence of <hi>Gregory,</hi> only Proveſt, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> did impolitick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in creating <hi>Julian, Coeſar,</hi> which I have proved in the reſolution of the 1ſt Queſt: but does not at all evince this Propoſition. But when he ſaith, <hi>The fault and miſchief of</hi> Conſtantius <hi>his action, was not becauſe</hi> Julian <hi>uſurp'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94184:92"/> him, nor upon any other conſideration whatſoever, but purely becauſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion ſuffer'd by it.</hi> This cannot be allowed; for <hi>Gallus</hi> his Brother being created <hi>Coeſar,</hi> tho' he was a great friend to the Chriſtians, and a Profeſſor of Chriſtianity, yet <hi>Conſtantius</hi> having a ſuſpition that he aſpir'd to the Empire, cut him off; and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> at the firſt notice, that he was ſaluted <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> nay, leſt his Victories ſhould gain ſo much upon the Army, that they would make him Emperor, ſent a Collonel to withdraw ſome of his beſt Soldiers from him; yet all this while <hi>Julian</hi> profeſſed Chriſtianity, and did not publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf a Pagan, till <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was dead. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> therefore is to be excuſed, becauſe he was ignorant, both as to his aſpiring to the Empire, and his Apoſtacy from Chriſtianity. <hi>Julian,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he accepted the Empire, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> greatly enraged, to appeaſe him, he beg'd that he might bear a ſhare in the Empire. Indeed <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and none but <hi>Conſtantius</hi> could lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Julian</hi> from the Empire: Tho' 'tis
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94184:92"/> true, that the Chriſtians had ſuch an averſion to a Pagan Succeſſor, that they could not indure him, when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their lawful Emperor; yet it was equally true, that they never could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the thoughts of taking up Arms againſt him. It muſt be acknowledged that they gave him evil words; yet it cannot be hence inferr'd that they would fight him. <hi>Hillarius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> wrote a ſharp Invective againſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> himſelf, tho' <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was a great lover of the Chriſtian Religion; yet ſeduc'd, by his Courtiers, he mov'd a violent Perſecution againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: No Chriſtians uſed more bitter expreſſions againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> than he did againſt <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> yet cannot any body ſee the leaſt word in his Invective, whereby he would animate the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtians to take up Arms againſt him.</p>
                  <p>It remains to examine, whether any actions of the Chriſtians did conclude, that if they could, they would have oppos'd <hi>Julian</hi> by Arms? <hi>Conſtantius</hi> it's certain did repent him that he did cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94184:93"/> 
                     <hi>Julian, Coeſar;</hi> none could devolve that power upon him, nor diveſt him of it, but <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> There's not one word in the famous Invective of <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen.</hi> to excite the Chriſtians to Arms; I will grant, that they reproach'd <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and his Religion to his Beard; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they did beat his Pagan Prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Face; but I deny that they would have done the ſame to him: That they prayed for his confuſion, and loaded his memory with the greateſt diſgrace, muſt be granted; but that from theſe their actions and words, muſt follow, that they would, if they could, have taken up Arms againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, In my Book called <hi>(The Clergies Honour)</hi> under the Head, <hi>The Loyalty of thoſe Fathers,</hi> I gave a full inſtance of their Paſſive Obedience: Withal, the Chriſtian Principle is, <hi>We muſt not do evil, that good may come on it:</hi> No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian for a temporal gain, by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a crime, muſt hazard his eternal happineſs. The firſt Chriſtians ſuffered according to the Laws of their Country, whereas theſe under <hi>Julian</hi> were perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94184:93"/> contrary to Law; ſo that the ſame men, who would have quietly ſubmitted to the Laws under a <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> do nevertheleſs purſue <hi>Julian,</hi> as if he were a Midnight-Thief, or a Highway-Robber. This is refuted before, where <hi>Julian's</hi> Laws had as great force as thoſe of <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> and that the Laws that <hi>Julian</hi> made, render the Chriſtians unable legally to take up Arms againſt him, if they could: His own practice gives an intimation, that he had that confidence in them. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in his ſervice (notwithſtanding thoſe Edicts which he publiſhed, to caſt out all Chriſtians out of his Army) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Commanders which were Chriſtians; ſuch was <hi>Valentinian,</hi> until he beat the Prieſt; and <hi>Jovian</hi> until his death; both which were afterwards Emperors: For he that has the power to make a Law, has the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation. And common Soldiers, of which an account we have in the former part of the Hiſtory, amongſt which were <hi>Juventius</hi> and <hi>Maximianus;</hi> he was extreamly politick, and it may be ſaid

He fighting with the Barbarous Nations, had Six hundred Soldiers new raiſed, <hi>milites gravis armaturoe,</hi> in theſe he put great confidence; though the Victory inclin'd to him, yet theſe ran away, whom neither promiſes, threats, nor his own perſonal aſſurance that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were flying, could recall: Theſe he did not, according to the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of War, deliver Captives into the hands of the Enemy; but caus'd them to be put in Womens Aparrel, and ſo dreſt, led them through the Army, which filled them with ſuch a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they eſteem'd the diſgrace worſe than death, and ſo enrag'd them, that at the next Battel they flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> like Lyons, did wonders, and was a great occaſion of obtaining the Victory. <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he ſaw his Army diſſolute, and inclin'd to Eſſemenacy, he put on Funeral weeds, and ſo walked about the Army, thus provoking the Soldiers to Valour, by caſting this reproach upon them,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94184:94"/> that ſuch an effeminate Army will be the cauſe of his and their Death. Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems are as neceſſary for a General, as Valour. A Prince that's fortunate, muſt have part of the Fox joyn'd to the Lyons heart. <hi>Theodoret.</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 15. Thus prefaceth of thoſe two Martyrs, <hi>Juven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Maximianus:</hi> Julian <hi>with the greateſt boldneſs, or rather with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, having put on the vizard of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prepares nets and ſnares to deſtroy Piety: There were two perſons famous in the Army, who were of the Emperors Foot-life-guard, and in a Feaſt with their fellow Soldiers, did bitterly bewail the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abominations of thoſe times, and uſed the admirable words of the three Children in</hi> Babylon; and further added, <hi>Thou haſt delivered us, O Lord, into the hands of an Apostate, a King more wicked than any that reigns in the world.</hi> Theſe words were related by ſome that ſat at Table with them; they were brought before <hi>Julian,</hi> who asked them, whether they ſaid thoſe words? This Queſtion of the King heightned their Courage, who thus replyed, <hi>We, O King, being bred up
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94184:95"/> in a true Religion, and obeying moſt holy Laws, we do bewail, when we ſee all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces filled with impiety, and moſt impious Sacrifices; our meat and drink defil'd: Theſe things are the cauſe of our bitter complaints, not only at home, but before your Majeſty.</hi> He hearing theſe words, puts off his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and makes his impiety to appear with an open face, and commanded them, after various and cruel torments, to be put to death: but did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Religion to be a cauſe of this ſentence, but their frenzy, that they ſhould abuſe the King; when Religion was the juſt cauſe: As in a Battel that he had with the <hi>Germans,</hi> he hid his Soldiers by Night in a Wood; ſo he vail'd his Perſecution with the ſhams of Sacriledge and Treaſon. The Inſtance that the Author gives of the Governor of <hi>Berea,</hi> is an evidence of this Truth. <hi>Theodoret, Lib. 3. Cap.</hi> 22. He ſeeing his Son haſtning to embrace the prevailing impiety, he drove him out of his Houſe, and publickly diſinherited him: The Young man haſtens to an adjoyning City, where the Emperor was, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94184:95"/> to him his Fathers Proſcription of him, and his own opinions: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror promiſes to reconcile him to his Father: When he came to <hi>Berea,</hi> he invites the chief men of the City, and with them his Father, to a Feaſt, and commands him to ſit at Table with him, the Emperor ſitting in the midſt, <hi>To me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it ſeems very unjuſt to force the mind of a perſon otherways inclin'd; you ought not to tempt your Son to embrace your Opinions, neither,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will I force you to believe what I believe, tho' I might eaſily compel you.</hi> The Governor ſharpning his diſcourſe about Divine things, thus return'd, <hi>O King, you have diſcourſed to me about this Villain, who is a hater of God, and a preferrer of a Lye to Truth.</hi> The Emperor rejoyns, and that with a ſeeming mildneſs, <hi>O Man, ceaſe rayling. Julian,</hi> tho' he ſaw the reſolute confidence of this Governour, yet did not diveſt him of his place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a confidence, that the Chriſtians would not take up Arms againſt him. It muſt be again weighed, that God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally proſpers good means. It may be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94184:96"/> every where obſerv'd, that evil courſes have had a bad ſucceſs.

A fatal cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity attended this <hi>Julian,</hi> his Wife and Children were hewn in pieces before his face, and himſelf was caſt into a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where he miſerably periſhed. If God ſend Plagues, or Famines, we muſt not fight, but ſend up our Prayers and Tears to Heaven.

The Mountebank Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Prayers and Tears, is an evil Droll. What <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Julians</hi> Perſecution, <hi>Eſt nubecula cito tranſitura,</hi>

This is the only caſe wherein the Goſpel requires Paſſive obedience, namely, when the Laws are againſt a man: and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94184:97"/> this was the caſe of the first Christians.</hi> All this I grant; but then I muſt ſay, that the ſame was of the Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Julian.</hi>

                  <p>To ſum up all, the ſtate of his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning Paſſive obedience is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The Life of <hi>Julian,</hi> and the carriage of Chriſtians under him, are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally croſs to his deſigns. Paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was ever eſteem'd the glory of Chriſtianity, which I hope we ſhall never experiment in <hi>England:</hi> May our Church flouriſh by the pious Lives, and devout Prayers, but never by the Blood of the Members of it.

Our famous <hi>Cowley,</hi> tho' he had ſerved his Sacred Majeſty, and the glorious Martyr, with great faithfulneſs and induſtry Fourteen years; yet for one Paragraph in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Firſt Edition of his Works, was depriv'd of the reward of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> when he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd an inſinuation into the minds of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94184:97"/> the Kings Friends, that <hi>their petty riſings would but be the ruine of their perſons and families: he knowing that an happy hour would come, when God would bend the hearts of the people of this Land as one Man, to bring back the King in Peace.</hi> My deſign is to diſſwade my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from avoiding all Military at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; and that the fears of Popery may not urge them to thoſe courſes, which will be the ruine of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Liberties: In Peace and Reſt will be our ſafety. Religion, of which Prayers is a principal part, is the Life of a Chriſtian, and the beſt ſupport of a Nation. The <hi>Fulminatrix Legio</hi> in <hi>Panonia</hi> was an evident teſtimony of it. <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antonius</hi> carries his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Germany,</hi> Fights the <hi>Quadi</hi> and <hi>Sarmatoe;</hi> his Army was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by Heat and want of Water: He addreſſes himſelf to the Country-gods, from whom no relief is found: In this great exigency he applies himſelf to the Chriſtian Soldiers that were in his Army, who proſtrating themſelves on the ground, and praying to the Holy Jeſus,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94184:98"/> there preſently fell Showers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; and Thunder and Hail from Heaven diſſipated the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> This famous Hiſtory is without queſtion true: 'Tis acknowledged, not only by Chriſtians, but alſo by Pagan Authors.

The noble carriage of the <hi>Thoebean</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Anno</hi> 297. gives an admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Chriſtians Conſtancy and Patience: This Legion, if the Chriſtian Laws had not prohibited, might have defended themſelves againſt <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as well as the Chriſtians againſt <hi>Julian.

               <p>IF ſuch an Intrinſick worth be in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how comes it to paſs, that Chriſtians are ſo cruel to Chriſtians? that no ſort of men proſecute one another with greater violence and hatred than Chriſtians do? 'Tis a ſad Character that <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> gives of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>No Tygers nor Wolves ſo cruel, as Chriſtians to Chriſtians.</hi> Thoſe moſt dreadful Perſecutions raiſed by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt Chriſtians, thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cruelty, wherewith Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have Tortured Chriſtians, are ſad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of this truth. To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that though the matter of Fact be confeſſed, yet Religion cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed culpable: It prompts not to anger, but meekneſs; not to Revenge, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94184:99"/> forgive; not to Fierceneſs and Cruelty, but to Humanity and Sweetneſs: It urges not War and Blood, but Health and Peace: the Maſter that Chriſtians ſerve, is the Prince of Peace; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is the Rule of their Lives, is the Goſpel of Peace; and the future happineſs to which they are invited, is a peaceable Habitation. <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> had a great conteſt with <hi>Creſcens</hi> a <hi>Cynick</hi> Philoſopher, who acted a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in his garb and demeanor, when otherwiſe he was one that hunted after Praiſe, indulged his Pleaſures, and immoderately heaped up Riches: he practiſed thoſe Vices which were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Virtues which are the ornaments of a true Philoſopher. This <hi>Creſcens</hi> ſlanders Chriſt: him <hi>Juſtin</hi> confutes, and proves him to be vicious and ignorant: this charge in his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy he profers to make good. <hi>Creſcens</hi> perceiving how he was bafled, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to procure the death of <hi>Juſtin;</hi> for which he thus reprehends him, That <hi>He who perſwaded others to deſpiſe Death, ſhould himſelf fear it; and he who exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94184:99"/> to a Patient and joyful enduring of Death, by reaſon it puts the Soul into har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, opens the Priſon-door, whereby the Soul is at Liberty, and enjoys a Bleſſed Immortality; yet endeavours to inflict death upon me as the greateſt evil.</hi> I may ſay the ſame of Chriſtians; how abſurd is it for them who believe a life Eternal, a future retribution, future torments, for which the quality and nature far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition, <hi>Ravilliac</hi>'s Tortures, or the dreadful miſeries which <hi>Moſes,</hi> one of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, endured in Fifteen days flaying, ſhould perſecute Chriſtians with the moſt feral cruelties which Policy and Malice can invent, or execute? This can't be imputed to our Religion, which for Meekneſs, Peace, Amiableneſs, and Love, is preferable to all the Religions in the World. 'Tis this Religion, which calls to endure, to ſuffer for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-ſake, to fry Ten thouſand Faggots with our Fleſh; to Purple as many Axes with our Blood, rather than ſin. That ſame Religion cannot prompt its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to ſuch bloody actions. We will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94184:100"/> confeſs, theſe things have given a great reaſon to complain of many Profeſſors of ſo excellent a Religion. Theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are no reproach to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> It muſt be granted, the Vices of moſt men are not a juſt reproach of humane nature.

Thoſe Wars managed with ſo great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that no Empire of the World ever did, or is ever in any probability to attain; thoſe they never commenced on the account of Religion: they revered the Tutelar gods of every Country, and therefore at the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a City, that they might the more eaſily conquer it, they did <hi>avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Deos:</hi> yet, what murthers, and the ſad effects of War they themſelves were the cauſes of, 'tis notoriouſly known. <hi>Pompey</hi> did glory that he was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Eleven hundred Thouſand men were deſtroyed: <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> that in the Torrent of his Victories, he ſhould be the cauſe of the death of

There is no ſuch eſtate of nature, nor is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceive ſuch an equality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt perſons; for if the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of man be by Creation, then by the Succeſſive generation the queſtion is determined: if we ſuppoſe men to be born by the prolifick power of <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſlime, and the benign influence of the Heavenly bodies, yet experience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us there is no ſuch equality natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.

No Fictions may be admitted which ſerve to explain the <hi>Phornomena</hi>'s of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies; but to admit ſuch Fictions which deſtroy Juſtice, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of giving the true nature of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, explaining it, is a moſt notorious abſurdity, and not to be endured. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs are not fictitious; though ſuch feral and Bloody actions have been perpetrated by Men, yet it doth not conclude, that mortals are diveſted of all humanity, or that there are no Laws wrote on the Breaſts of men, which may be fairly read in the juſt lives of many excellent perſons: As Cruelties acted by men upon men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not humanity, ſo the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Spirit of ſome Chriſtians, do not juſtly caſt an imputation on Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty its ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will not be amiſs to enquire, when this perſecuting and bloody ſpirit invaded the Breaſt of Chriſtians? It
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94184:101"/> muſt be acknowledged, that during the firſt Ten Perſecutions no ſuch ſpirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. There was great diviſions, many Hereſies, yet the true Church maintained its ſelf by holineſs of Life, patient ſuffering of Tortures, and an excellent diſcipline: The only allurements to Chriſtians, were a future glory, and terror, Eternal puniſhments: but when the Emperors became Chriſtians, that reſtleſs Enemy of Mankind, and the great oppoſer of Chriſt Jeſus, imploy'd all his Arts to make Chriſtians act upon Chriſtians thoſe cruelties Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did. In the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the great, <hi>Arrius</hi> was raiſed up by Satan to diſturb Chriſtianity; he colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſome former Hereticks had not ſo clearly broached, declared in the Church of <hi>Alexandria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that <hi>Chriſt was not true God, coeſſential with the Father.</hi> Whence ſprung thoſe firſt Perſecutions of Chriſtians againſt Chriſtians, but on the <hi>Arrian</hi> account? Under <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Great no Perſecutions were moved. His Son <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> to whom he gave his Empire of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94184:102"/> prompted, though not by his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but his Court-Paraſites, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Eudoxia</hi> his Empreſs, a perſon of great Learning and Spirit, to perſecute the Orthodox and Catholick Chriſtians. <hi>Conſtantinus Junior,</hi> and <hi>Conſtans.</hi> Brother of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> governed in the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> theſe did not at all diſturb any ſort of Chriſtians. <hi>Julian</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> his Perſecutions we have recited. <hi>Jovian</hi> by the Acclamations of the Army was immediately created Emperor, who being a Religious and Orthodox prince, moved no perſecutions, but gave even to Hereticks Liberty. On his death <hi>Valentinian</hi> was inveſted with the Eaſtern and Weſtern Purple: the Soldiers, after his Election, in a tumult, declared that another ſhould be his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate; he in a reſolute, yet complying Speech, acquainted the Army, that it was in their Power not to have elected him; but having elected him, it was in his power to appoint a time when a Colleague ſhould be choſen: taking his opportunity, he by the conſent of the Army cauſed his Brother <hi>Valens</hi> to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94184:102"/> choſen his aſſociate: To him the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Purple was aſſigned. To ſee the Power of God! <hi>Jovianus</hi> enjoyed the Empire but Eight Months: the Army proceeding to another election, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a great Soldier, a wiſe perſon, and moſt religious Chriſtian, Emperor, who made then, with the conſent of the Army, <hi>Valens</hi> his Partner; at that time an Orthodox and Catholick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who under <hi>Julian</hi> profeſſed the true Doctrine; but marrying a Princeſs, who was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> inſtilling thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Doctrines into the head of him a Soldier, and being Baptized by <hi>Eudox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and by him at his Baptiſm ſworn to maintain the <hi>Arrian</hi> impieties, he proved a moſt dreadful Perſecutor: God was ſo angry with him, as to ſubſtract his Grace, that falling from the true Faith, he ſcarce appeared to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and being vanquiſhed by the <hi>Goths;</hi> he was forced to take Shelter in a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, where he was reduced to Aſhes. At <hi>Antioch,</hi> the famous <hi>Miletius</hi> being Baniſhed, when he kept his Court in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94184:103"/> that City, he gave to perſons of all perſuaſions full Liberty publickly to perform their religious Offices; he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues, and the Pagan Temples, and gave a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to all that owned the name of Chriſtians, to Hereticks, and thoſe who divulged opinions contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Faith. By his connivance and approbation, the Myſteries and Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Heathens were celebrated. Thoſe cheats were ſuppreſſed by <hi>Jovian;</hi> Then began to flouriſh Ceremonies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and Religious Rites of <hi>Jupiter; Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> were celebrated; and this was done, not in Corners, as in the Reign of Religious Emperors: but now in the midſt of the City. In the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> they wildly ran up and down, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performing their <hi>Orgias.</hi> He is only an enemy to thoſe who profeſs and preach the Apoſtolical Faith. Theſe he firſt drove out of their holy Churches: they then convened upon the tops of Mountains, there they heard the Words of God, there they glorifyed God with Hymns and Praiſes. To perform Divine
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94184:103"/> Exerciſes, they endured the violence of all ſort of Weather; Storms, Snow, Froſt, and Scorching heats.

The cruelties of theſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Baſil</hi> does lively deſcribe in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Weſtern Biſhops: the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the <hi>Arrians</hi> were dreadful: the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had liberty, till they grew violent; then their Churches were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and ſome of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops puniſhed; but they becoming Bloody, and a Sect amongſt them eſpecially called the <hi>Circumcelliones,</hi> a feral and rabid company, acting Barbarities upon the Catholicks, they were reſtrained by more ſevere Laws.

                  <hi>3dly,</hi> An erroneous and wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple imbib'd, may be the Reaſon of Perſecution. Religion is not the cauſe of it, but mens ignorance, paſſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and evil apprehenſions of things. Becauſe the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did not receive Chriſt, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Wilt thou command fire down from Heaven to conſume them?</hi> Luk. 9. When Zeal, like raging Fire, does not warm, but deſtroy, lays Towns and Cities in Aſhes, no wonder they condemn to the Flames thoſe whom they account Hereticks. What blood will not thoſe perſons ſhed? What Murders will not they commit? what cruelties not exerciſe, when inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by an erroneous Conſcience, and believe, that when they kill their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren they do God good ſervice? But this is abſolutely contrary to the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus. 'Tis true, by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Blaſphemer was to be put to death. In the new Law, <hi>He that will not hear the Church, let him be as an Heathen, or Publican,</hi> Matt. 18. <hi>I wiſh they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 5. But from theſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94184:104"/> words, to prove, that it is meritorious to put an Heathen on a Rack, broyl a Publican on a Gridiron, and to cut off the thread of a Schiſmaticks Life by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of cruelty, is as ridiculous as that of a <hi>Sciolus. Hoereticum devita; an Heretick reject.</hi> To turn it, <hi>de vita tolle, take away the life of an Heretick;</hi> it is unqueſtionably true. The Goſpel commands no corporal puniſhment: The Church pronounceth the perſon an Heretick; but the ſentencing of that Heretick to the Fire, and the executing of that ſentence, was performed by the Civil Judge and his Officers. I muſt not be miſinterpreted, as tho' I judged, that a corporal puniſhment may not be inflicted upon thoſe who are real Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, granting that Conſcience can't be forced; yet it muſt be concluded, that an erroneous perſon may be forc'd to thoſe actions which may alter his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No Boy can be forc'd to believe, that <hi>(amo)</hi> ſignifies <hi>(I Love);</hi> yet a Boy may be juſtly forced to go to School, and to attend to his Maſters Lectures, and by that means he may be convinc'd,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94184:105"/> that <hi>(amo)</hi> doth ſignifie to <hi>(Love)</hi> And this was the caſe of the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> For St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> a Man of a meek and Divine temper, who very well knew the ſweetneſs of the Goſpel, and the greatneſs of mans infirmity, was againſt any Penal Laws, in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical: But when the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were compell'd to reſtore the Churches, which under <hi>Julian</hi> were taken from the Catholicks, and to come to Divine Prayers, and to the hearing of Orthodox Sermons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were converted: Upon this St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> approves of that ſeverity: But that perſons being ſubject to their Prince, demeaning themſelves ſoberly, merely for an opinions ſake, ſhould be kill'd as Dogs, and that by all feral means, to extirpate that which they call Hereſy, is meritorious, is not the product of Religion, but of Prejudice and Paſſion. What a ſcandal did this give to the Name and Faith of the Lord Jeſus? The <hi>Indian</hi> King would not be in Heaven, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were there. What bloody Tragedies have been acted over all <hi>Enrope</hi> on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94184:105"/> This ſavours not of the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſweetneſs of Chriſtianity. The Religion of the Holy Jeſus muſt not be reproached by the paſſions and evil opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> All are not Chriſtians that call themſelves ſo; all are not <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that are in the School of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> A feral ſpirit amongſt many who call themſelves Chriſtians, ariſes not only from an ill guided Zeal, but from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples contrary to the deſign of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. The Faith of the Lord Jeſus is pretended, when ambition and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proſperity are deſign'd. And this has been undoubtedly the original of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſlaughters amongſt Chriſtians, which have been vailed with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of Piety.

After the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, when a great Army was raiſed for that end, by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, the Swords of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94184:106"/> in the Weſt were turn'd againſt the Chriſtians in the Eaſt: Under that ſacred vail was hid the deſign of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Eaſtern to the obedience of the Weſtern Church. The Ambition of <hi>Rome</hi> was to ſet up a <hi>Latin</hi> Empire Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Civil, in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church and State. The Gun-powder Treaſon in <hi>England,</hi> whence proceeded it but from ambition? The late feral Plot; acknowledged to be Deviliſh by His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty and Three Parliaments, Let Religion be pretended, what was under the Varniſh? <hi>Coleman,</hi> a name execrable, not only to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> but to <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> a Muſhrom gaining favour, durſt be ſo arrogant as to attempt the introducing of Popery, make the Engliſh Scepter truckle to <hi>France.</hi> What was his aim? To be a great Miniſter of State. The ſame was propoſed by thoſe who aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in theſe deteſtable actions.

They who fall from one Religion to another, muſt diſguiſe their Apoſtacy with the faireſt vails of Conſcience, Salvation, and a future Glory: Yet they give a reproach to themſelves, and to Religion; when they deſign their Apoſtacy to open a Gate for preferment, no wonder that theſe perſons prove Perſecutors.

But we have here an Apoſtate from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who not only imitates, but outvies this <hi>Theodorus.

                  <hi>Julian</hi> (againſt whom theſe Papers are chiefly deſign'd) was a Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous by many excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Amongſt the Heathens there were many Philoſophers and Stateſmen, Orators, Generals and Princes eminent in their ſingular qualifications. Is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour a Virtue? Many were patient in bearing Calamities, and none more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in undertaking great actions. Is Juſtice a Virtue? they were diligent hearers of Cauſes, and unbiaſſed in their final determinations. Is Temperance a Virtue? They were to a Miracle Abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious. Is Charity a Virtue? they were
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94184:110"/> Bountiful, and haters of the baſe ſin of Covetouſneſs. If a compoſure of mind, by which perſons are fitted for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions; If induſtry and vigorous proſecution of Employments be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ornaments, in them they might glory. To all which may be added, in the Exerciſe of Religion, which is the foundation of Virtue, they were very devout. To all theſe they made a great pretence: Some of thoſe Eminences muſt be granted; yet to the Queſtion, it will with clear Reaſon, and certain Truth be replied, That the excellency of Chriſtian Graces and Virtues, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatively to be prefer'd to Pagan Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences. To evince which, theſe Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms muſt be premis'd.</p>

               <p n="2">2. When Virtues are intenſe, then they are concatenated; there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94184:111"/> of all Virtues, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are Heroical.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the fam'd Philoſophers agree in this, That there is a true God, whoſe Will is the rule of Virtue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That then it muſt evidently follow, That they who worſhip not the true God, are not Virtuous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis evidently perſpicuous, that Virtues muſt have a reſpect to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate objects: He that is Temperate, muſt both eat and drink moderately; he that is Juſt, muſt be ſo to all perſons.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That to the Conſtitution, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is required: If this were not the Guide of the Pagan <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> then it muſt of neceſſity follow, they were not truly virtuous.</p>
               <p>My Pen ſhall not be too crabbed, nor my ſentiments too bold in cenſuring the ſtate of dead Philoſophers. What ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the Divine Power hath paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, is known to him only, to whom belongs righteouſneſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.

               <p n="1">1. Let the actions of any perſon be never ſo exact and congruous to thoſe Laws which goodneſs preſcribe; yet if the end be vain-glory, they are not true Virtues. Ambition is that defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which ſullies the ſplendor of the beſt Converſation, in that life, which ſeems to be a mirror to give the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt image of Goodneſs: As the pureſt Chryſtal is by breath; ſo that, by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, is ſtain'd; which vice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely oppos'd by Chriſtian Religion: Humility being adopted as a part of it; it's one of its prime conſtitutions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the example of the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

               <p n="2">2. We ſhall rarely find, that there was a Concatenation of all Virtues in Heathen Philoſophers; and in them, their Virtues had not a reſpect to their adequate objects: which is otherwiſe in Chriſtians. In many thouſands of them gloriouſly appear'd a concurrence of all Graces. 'Tis a Chriſtian Axiom: <hi>He that offends in one, is guilty of all.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Graces are like a Crown, or Circle, in which if there be any part taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that ceaſeth to be a Circle. From the Principles of Chriſtianity, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly is prov'd; for the form of a Chriſtian Grace, is <hi>the Love of God in Chriſt.</hi> That Love cauſeth a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to abſtain from all Vice, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice every Command. Multitudes in whom neither impurities, injuſtice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, irreligion, weakneſs and timerouſneſs of ſpirit, or any other vice
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94184:113"/> did appear; and when any vice was committed, they waſhed away the ſtain by Tears, and remov'd the guilt by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and were never quiet, until they recover'd their former purity. They liv'd embeliſh'd with all Virtues. Where was there any Heathen, in whom one great Vice or other was not ſeen? The conſideration of their Idolatry muſt be rejected, until the third and fourth Particulars be conſidered. This preſent diſcourſe is directed to the proof of the ſecond and fifth Particulars: To perform which, we'l take a view of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Laws and Lives, and the Dogma's and Converſations of the Heathen <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi</hi> If we caſt our eyes on the Sacred Code of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we can ſee no Command, but that which is holy, juſt and good; any impurity is ſo far from being countenanced, that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure thought, nay, a wanton look is prohibited by the purity of the Laws of the Holy Jeſus. A luſtful caſting of the eyes, is accounted Adultery. Such an exact Juſtice, that rather than any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries ſhould be done, injuries and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94184:113"/> are to be indured. Chriſtianity is ſo far from admitting Injuſtice, that it commands the remiſſion of Injuries, and to return good for evil. 'Tis true, that in late ages, in which there has been a decay of Piety, the Generality have the name, not the life and eſſence of Chriſtians: yet in the purer ages of the Church, how eminent the Lives of Chriſtians have been, how glorious in the moſt compleat compoſure of their converſations, the enemies of Chriſtians had confeſſed and admired: and ſtill there are thoſe, who for purity are Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and cloathed in white; that lead Angelical Lives, and live as out of the Body: They are ſo far from acting, or patronizing any filthineſs, or injuſtice, or affecting Vain-glory, that impure motions they abhor: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Eſtates in Charity: by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification they raiſe their Bodies, that they become the Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt: and their whole life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to their Maker.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94184:116"/> Inferior Deities, ſome Spirits more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than Men, who were the <hi>Dii Patrii, &amp; Dii medioxumi.</hi> Patrons of Countries, and Nations, Towns and Families; nay perſons: They believed that God the ſupreme Deity, conveyed his Will and Pleaſure to Men and Nations by their Tutelar Deities whom they adored. The notion of a Deity included in it, his Will to be the meaſure of all mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 'Tis evinced by the nature of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that an outward action is not Virtuous, except conducted by the mind. The Courage of a Lion, or an Engliſh Maſtiff is not fortitude. 'Tis Reaſon that conducts the Act, and makes it Virtuous or Vicious: and the conſent of all Nations, is, that the Rule of their Lives, ought to be the Will of God. To make Laws to be readily entertained, they feigned they were given by their gods. <hi>Plato</hi> begins his Dialogue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Laws with this queſtion, <hi>Was God or Man the maker of Laws?</hi> And the anſwer is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God, God was the Cauſe. Numa Pompilius</hi> perſwaded the

Hence it will neceſſarily follow, that they who have not the knowledge of the True God, cannot guide their actions by thoſe true Meaſures, as they may, who receive infallible Oracles from the true God. That the greateſt of their Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo's, as <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> were Idolaters, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Zenophons</hi> ſayings, and facts of <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſaith of him, <gap reason="foreign">

He ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the <hi>Grecian</hi> gods, and offered a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94184:117"/> Cock to <hi>Eſculapius. Plutarch</hi> approves the adoration of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars: for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>'tis impoſſible to think, that the World would conſpire in Worſhipping of them, if they were not animated; de Placitis Philoſophorum. Seneca</hi> is reproved juſtly and ſeverly by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in that when he condemns the Superſtition of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Sacrifices and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their gods, yet he permits them to conform to the Laws, <hi>Auſtin de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei. Lib. 6. Cap.</hi> 10. In this the great Moraliſt muſt be extraordinarily peccant, who would act thoſe things which were conformable to the Laws, yet theſe he judged ungrateful to their gods. Thus thoſe Philoſophers, who made a great pretence to Virtue, yet in common reaſon, cannot be excuſed from Idolatry. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms, that <hi>Ploti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Jamblicus, Porphyrius, Appuleius,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf Sacrificed to divers gods. <hi>De Civit. Dei Lib. 8. Cap.</hi> 12. When 'tis evinced in <hi>Plato,</hi> eaſily it will be granted in others; nor can this be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Narrative which <hi>Eunapius</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:94184:117"/> gives of the Lives of Philoſophers, is a certain evidence, that they worſhipped many gods, and were skilful in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. <hi>Maximus</hi> (by the command of that Religious Emperor <hi>Theodoſius)</hi> was put to death, for being a Magician. To prove the verity of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> cenſure of <hi>Plato,</hi> no other Teſtimony need be uſed, than his own words expreſly in his <gap reason="foreign">

Ficinus</hi> in his Preface ſaith, that, <hi>by Heaven,</hi> Plato <hi>there meant the Incorporeal, and inviſible Heaven: the Idea of which he commands to be adored through the viſible, it's repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. Ficinus,</hi> to vindicate <hi>Plato,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſome Artifices eſteemed amongſt the Papiſts; but this clears him not from Idolatry. 'Tis frequent with <hi>Plato</hi> to command Honour to be given, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94184:118"/> to be offered to a multitude of gods: <hi>Quarto de Legib. Pag. 8 32. Let us be convinced, that 'tis a clear and certain truth, that we are obliged to Sacrifice to the gods; that we be converſant in holy actions, Prayers, Oblations, and all manner of Divine Service: this is the moſt Lovely and moſt Excellent; 'Tis that which conduceth to a moſt happy Life. The Honours being performed to the Heavenly Gods, and thoſe Gods who are Protectors and Patrons of Common-Wealths; that perſon obtains the end of Piety, who to Terreſtrial gods offers congruous, though inferior Service. After theſe, a Wiſe man will Sacrifice to</hi> Hero's, <hi>to</hi> Daemons, <hi>in conſequence to the proper Images of the Country gods, as the Law preſcribes.</hi> Thus far <hi>Plato.</hi> No Subject, let him be extoll'd for extraordinary Wiſdom, ſingular Temperance, unuſual Charity, undaunted Courage, exact Juſtice in Commerce; yet is moſt unjuſt, and makes his Virtues Vices, if he heads his Rebellion againſt his Natural Prince, and abuſes all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94184:118"/> to promote it. Idolatry is a Treaſon againſt Heaven. It was this which ſoiled the Embelliſhments of the greateſt Pliloſophers, and eclipſed the Luſtre of their greateſt Excellencies. The Idolatry and Magick of <hi>Julian</hi> is in the former diſcourſe: how weak and erronious is a natural underſtanding! <hi>The Wiſdom of Man is fooliſhneſs with God.</hi> O weak Mortals! happy were the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Revelations: happier the Chriſtians, who ſee the Glory of God Shining in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As 'tis granted; that Prudence is the chiefeſt of all Cardinal Virtues; ſo it muſt be acknowledged, that thoſe Virtues which are guided by a Divine, are ſuperior to thoſe which are conduct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by a natural Wiſdom: The Original of all Prudence, is, that Eternal Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Sun, from which all the Rays of Wiſdom, whether Natural or Divine are emitted: So true is that of <hi>Job, There is a Spirit in a Man; and the Inſpiration of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94184:119"/> the Almighty giveth underſtanding, Job</hi> 32. 8. The Rays that are in the Soul by nature, or that Candle of the Lord which is placed in the Soul, at its producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives a faint and weak light; but vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and clear Beams (that fair and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Candle) which ſhines with the ſweeteſt and cleareſt Splendour, placed in the Golden Candleſtck, the Church, the Pillar and ground of Truth: and herein is the clear proelation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their actions and graces, to thoſe of the Heathen; for Chriſtians are conducted by the beſt means; to the beſt end. That there is an enmity by nature between God and Man, the Sins that men are guilty of, are a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, though certain Argument. That man endeavours to reconcile himſelf to God, and to appeaſe the Divine Wrath, and that by Sacrifices, is manifeſt by the common uſage of the World. All Nations unanimouſly agree in this; all people in all ages ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their propitiatory Sacrifices to God. The Heathens did believe that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94184:119"/> the Sacrifices they offered to their gods, did really appeaſe the anger of thoſe Deities: Hence ſome Nations ſacrificed men and women; and <hi>Julian</hi> rip'd up the Bellies of Women. In <hi>Gaul</hi> they fed men on purpoſe a whole year, that there might be offered a moſt excellent Sacrifice to their gods. Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> they who did devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the gods were accounted <hi>Hero's.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had their Sacrifices appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Sanction: they were propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but as Types, their Virtue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him, who was the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World: The Wrath of God being ſolely to be ſatisfyed by that Sacrifice which was equivalent. This was the ſweet accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrifice of him, who was God and man; man to be a Sacrifice, God to render that Sacrifice of a due Value: the Piety was the Altar to Sanctify the Sacrifice. This is that myſtery hid from Ages, that God ſhould become man; that by offering his own Body he might make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94184:120"/> for Man; by his own Blood he might enter into the Holy place, making eternal Redemption for us: by one ſacrifice once offer'd, he might, ever perfect thoſe who are ſanctified. He gave the moſt excellent Commands and Rules of Living, which he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his own evample: He was ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from Sin; his Life was the pattern of all goodneſs, and invited men by the Promiſes of an Eternal Glory. How blind the eyes of Reaſon and natural Philoſophy are, the ſentiments of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, which concern the ultimate end of Man, eaſily manifeſt. Did <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Zeno</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in what, compleat Beatitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted? were it to be found in any of the Academies ancient, middle, or new? In the <hi>Stoa,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Forum?</hi> No. The <hi>Metempſuchoſts</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is an abſurd fiction, and deſtroys the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Divine Providence, by making a retribution in the next life, which cannot be granted, if that be conceded. <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to have the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94184:120"/> cleareſt apprehenſion of the Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and a future Life, as the ſtate of the Soul is when living, and in that condition with thoſe qualities, when ſeperated from the Body, ſentenced to bliſs or torture: <hi>As,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Body is full of Scars, or the Members diſlocated, it will be ſo when dead. The ſame with the Soul: the Filth, Wounds, and Deformitys, which it contracted when in the Body, will remain, and be ſeen, when ſeperated. The Soul which by Virtue is made pure, and beautiful, when in the Body, retains that ſame purity and beauty being ſeparated.</hi> And further, that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Souls have their various Seats in Heaven, and are happy, by poſſeſſing a perfect good, which is God, and this to continue for ever: and is obtained more by Loving, than by knowing.</hi> Theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations are curious and ingenious; theſe approach near to Chriſtianity: and certainly the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato</hi> was a preparation for the Goſpel. We evinced before, that the beſt Principles of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>'s moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94184:121"/> came ſhort of the Code of Jeſus Chriſt: So when we conſider the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Lord, we ſhall find, that theſe Speculations are inferiot to it; for as to the judgment of the laſt day, 'tis clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed, that the Son of Man ſhall deſcend from Heaven, and ſhall place his Pavillion in the Clouds, and Judge the World. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Gorgias,</hi> tells, that <hi>to the three Sons of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>the laſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature is committed.</hi> Minos, Rhadaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, <hi>and</hi> Aeacus <hi>being in a certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in</hi> Bivio, <hi>where are two ways, one leading to the Iſles of the Bleſſed, the other to Hell: the naked Souls of theſe Judges viewing the naked Souls of men, to ſend the Virtuous to Heaven, the vicious to Hell.</hi> Minos <hi>and</hi> Rhadaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus <hi>are the Judges of the</hi> Aſians, <hi>and</hi> Aeacus <hi>of the</hi> Europeans. <hi>Let what</hi> Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>ſays of</hi> Plato'<hi>s Opinion, be</hi> Plato'<hi>s ſence, that by</hi> Saturn <hi>is intended the Supreme Intelligence, in whom is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Law and Providence over all things: Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to him are three principal Deitys; Who gives the eſſence and form of Beings,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94184:121"/> is called</hi> Jupiter; <hi>who gives life is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Neptune; <hi>who diſpoſes the orders and degrees of Forms is called</hi> Plato; <hi>and the three Sons of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>Judges of</hi> Aſia <hi>and</hi> Europe, <hi>are three Deities, Servants of</hi> Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Plato, <hi>deſigned for that Office.</hi> Chriſtianity acquaints us, that there is but one only God; that God did aſſume our nature; that he will judge the World. <hi>Plato</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth other gods, theſe three Judges to take a view of the naked Souls, by inſpection to paſs the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Chriſtianity ſaith, <hi>the Books ſhall be opened,</hi> that is, the Divine Omniſcience, which clearly diſcovers the actions, and knows the eſtate of every one, ſhall diſcern the deeds of every individual perſon: And the Conſciences of all perſons are another Book, in which are written the Sins and Graces of every perſon: all ſhall then be ſo awakened and diſpoſed, as they ſhall give a faithful account. This is a rational account of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and excluſive Tribunal. How
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94184:122"/> can thoſe three Judges paſs a juſt ſentence, except they know of the Crime and Virtues of every Soul, which they can't do except they be Omniſcient? And when they have paſſed the ſentence, how are the Souls ſent their ſeveral ways? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that power which brought every Soul into ſuch a Meadow, and conveyed the Souls to the places to which they are ſentenced, muſt be Infinite: whereby it muſt be one, not three ſubordinate Deities: Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience and Omnipotence are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties belonging to the true and only God. The account of the Chriſtian felicity is clear: An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul, which through the aid of Heaven, the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſubjecting the Body to its ſelf, and gaining a ſpiritual conqueſt over it, making it ſubſervient to Reaſon and Religion, when ſeparated from the body, aſcends into Heaven, where it hath an immediate and full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in the underſtanding
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94184:122"/> and will, by a clear and full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and view of God, by that which we uſually call <hi>Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> And this immediate Viſion; which is Divine, filis the Will with the moſt ardent Love of God; whence ſprings all imaginable joy and delight, and this to continue for ever. <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaks very delicately of this happineſs, when he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that <hi>Happineſs doth conſiſt in the poſſeſſion of God: That Souls come from, and return to God again; that the poſſeſſion of God chiefly conſiſts in the Loving him above all things.</hi> Yet it muſt be acknowledged, that great Perſon commended to the World for his Eloquence, Holineſs of his Life, and Pen, receiv'd the knowledge of theſe things from the <hi>Jews;</hi> which is obſerved by <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> and <hi>Leonard Coquoeus</hi> the Jeſuits, in their Commentaries upon St. <hi>Auſtin de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Dei,</hi> Lib. 22. Cap. 28. And our Learned <hi>Gale, Court of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> Part. 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 7. and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94184:123"/> affirm'd, he hath ſo mixt the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, that it very much ſinks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Evangelical Diſcovery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, <hi>Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 10. The fulleſt diſcovery of an Eternal Life and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was made by the Holy Jeſus; Which will farther appear to thoſe perſons, who were the preſervers of their Country, advancers of its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, enlargers of its Territories and Dominions; and was aſſign'd the greateſt ſhare of Glory in the World to come. This the intent of <hi>Scipio</hi> evinceth, <hi>Sed quanquam ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tho' Religion, upon the performance of excellent acts, is a moſt ample reward of Virtue; yet thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections are not ſatisfied with thoſe honours, which Images ſtanding upon Lead, or Triumphs adorn'd with fading Laurels give it; but requires that Remuneration which is more flouriſhing and permanent: Therefore, O African, that thou mayſt be more
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94184:123"/> ready to defend thy Country; be certain that to thoſe who preſerve Common-wealths, are the ſupporters of it, and extenders of its Empire, a peculiar Manſion is aſſign'd, in which they ſhall enjoy perpetual felicity: That place is in the Milky-way, from whence the ſouls ſlide into the body, and to which they return:</hi> In which Circle <hi>Scipio</hi> thought himſelf to be, when he ſo dream'd. <hi>Macrobius</hi> knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well the mind of <hi>Plato,</hi> with whom <hi>Cicero</hi> agreed in his Book <hi>de Repub. Julian,</hi> ſaith <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> thus comforted his Courtiers that bewailed his Death; <hi>It was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and mean, to bewail that Prince who ſhould be placed amongſt the Stars.</hi> From which 'tis evidently deduced, that there was amongſt them an apprehenſion of a future and eternal Felicity: but whether there was not a miſtake amongſt them concerning the means to attain it, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity it ſelf, there may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to judge? Political Virtues are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94184:124"/> made the moſt ſuitable conditions to attain it. Let us ſuppoſe Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Generals Fight againſt Virtuous Generals, who conduct virtuous Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers againſt virtuous Soldiers: Let this inſtance be given amongſt a Thouſand others: <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Thebes</hi> take Arms one againſt another; the Commanders in chief are <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> for <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> for <hi>Thebes:</hi> both which intenſively loved their native Countries; to preſerve their Cities they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually inclin'd: both were endued with Political Virtues. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had that glory to make the <hi>Spartans</hi> know, that an Enemy could paſs the River <hi>Eurotas,</hi> which no Hoſtile Army had done for Six hundred years: yet this <hi>Epaminondas</hi> dyed by a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Spear. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> reviv'd the drooping ſpirits of his Country-men, who being incenſed againſt him, forced him into <hi>Egypt;</hi> returning to preſerve his Country, dyed. Are both theſe happy? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94184:124"/> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> as <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirms of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who ſaw from the <hi>Galaxy, Carthage:</hi> They muſt be likewiſe amongſt the Stars. Yet they were enemies, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one Country is the ruine of another. What account can be given that they were both happy? None but this, that both of them went to the <hi>Dii Patrii:</hi> whence it follows, they did not believe that the happineſs of ſeparated Souls did conſiſt in the poſſeſſion of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, but of ſubordinate Deities: Therefore that felicity of ſeperated Souls cannot be perfect, thoſe Deities themſelves being but finite. And <hi>Plato</hi>'s conceit is not ſuited to that of a Divine Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, when he affirms, That future Beatitude, being gain'd by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Virtues, Prudence, Fortitude, Juſtice, Temperance, as the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Soul, when united, exerciſed more heroically a more peculiar Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. So its happineſs in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94184:125"/> of God, conſiſts in the perſection of that ſame Virtue. As he that excell'd in Valour, his fortitude then ſhall be accompliſhed: ſo the reſt: When that true Beatitude, which is in a beatifical Viſion, brings all Graces then to be exerciſed in that eſtate; as Faith and Hope ceaſe in Heaven, ſo thoſe Virtues. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which directs by the beſt means, to the beſt ends: What need of that Virtue, when there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of perfect bliſs? No object of Fortitude: Heaven admits of no Enemy, no ſorrow, or any evil. No object of Juſtice: no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, becauſe no contracts; nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive, for God only rewards and puniſhes. Nor any of Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for there's no <hi>Nectar</hi> or <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia.</hi> But what <hi>Macrobius</hi> aſſerts in <hi>Somnio Scip.</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 11. That <hi>there are Two Gates in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, one in</hi> Cancer, <hi>the other in</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricornus; <hi>per has duas portas animos de coelo in terram meare,</hi> &amp;c. And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94184:125"/> by theſe 'tis believed they return from Earth into Heaven; the one the Gate of the immortal Gods, the other of Men: For by that the Souls of Men return to that ſeat in which they are eternally bleſſed: And the Souls returning from the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> they then enter into the Dominions belonging to <hi>Pluto.</hi> For Infants newly born, are fed with Milk, to immind them that they came from the Milky-way. The Soul of Man by its innate power of moving its ſelf, ſliding from the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,</hi> and Milky circle, into the lower Orbs, is clothed with a body of light, and exerciſeth it ſelf with thoſe actions which are proper for each Sphere. In that of <hi>Saturn,</hi> thoſe of Wiſdom and Intelligence; of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the practice of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior things; of <hi>Mars,</hi> heat and courage; of the <hi>Sun,</hi> fancy and imagination: of <hi>Venus,</hi> deſire and appetite; of <hi>Mercury,</hi> Eloquence;

               <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> placed their Felicity in Virtue, which they eſteemed their God. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the ſame; but Virtue cannot be the ultimate end of Man, when it is the condition and means of attaining it. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> placeth happineſs in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind both, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Maſter, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94184:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the gods. Indeed both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> the one by aſſerting an eternal matter, the other an eternal motion, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thoſe opinions which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much derogatory to the Power and Majeſty of God. <hi>Moſes,</hi> that gave the true account of the worlds being created out of nothing, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies our reaſon, that nothing can be infinite, no, not Eternal but only God; and that Infinite can produce a Being out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that motion is cauſed by that Mover, who himſelf is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. And the Sacred Oracle, a Divine Revelation gives the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſatisfying account of true Beatitude: the knowledge of which, the wiſeſt Philoſophers not attaining, 'tis paſt ſcruple, that their Virtues were not of that eminency and luſtre as thoſe of Chriſtians. That Queen of Virtues, Prudence, which governs the actions of men,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94184:128"/> was reigning in the Hearts of Chriſtians with more abſolute perfections, than in the minds of the moſt Virtuous Heathens. This moſt amiable and beauteous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by Chriſtian Philoſophy, directs her Subjects to place their happineſs, not on the Earth, but Heaven; not in the Creature, but the Creator; the God bleſſed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And clearly manifeſts, that pious perſons are made fully happy in the Poſſeſſion of God, by Viſion and Love. Divines thus inſtructed, more truly, with greater Sublimity, profeſs God to be the Rewarder of Virtuous Actions.
